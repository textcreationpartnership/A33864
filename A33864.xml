            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A PREFACE TO THE WORKS OF M. Saraſin.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y Friends, who have ſometimes heard me ſpeak againſt Prefaces, will wonder perhaps to ſee me undertake for the Works of Monſieur <hi>Saraſin,</hi> what I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver advis'd any to do for his own: But let me apply to theſe things what a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous man once ſaid of Funeral Pomps and the Rights of Sepulchre, <hi>'Tis honeſt to be careful for other mens, but
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:62940:3"/>not to trouble our ſelves about our own.</hi> And certainly if there be nothing leſs praiſe-worthy than to go in queſt of that praiſe we have deſerv'd, who ſees not that theſe great number of Prefaces wherewith Authors do ſwell their Books, excepting ſome wherein Diſcretion and Judgment ſhines throughout, and which are either very neceſſary or very uſeful, all the reſt, though ſtrow'd with the Flowers of Eloquence, and highly pompous, deſerve more blame than praiſe. For to what purpoſe is it to entertain the Reader at the Entrance with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie of that which they preſent him, with the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties they met withal, and the qualifications neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to ſurmount them; to intreat, to flatter him in ſome places; to ſcorn and defie him in others, to ſpeak ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with ſubmiſſion, and ſometimes with empire, as if we would force their liking; or elſe, as a <hi>Spaniard</hi> pleaſantly ſays, <hi>ask it with tears in our eyes;</hi> diſcovering to the World a weakneſs by ſo much the greater as we are not able to diſſemble it? If our Works are good, let us be aſſur'd upon the Faith of all Ages, and all that ever was wrote handſomly, that ſooner or later the World will do us right, tho we free our ſelves from the ſhame of ſolliciting it: If they are bad or imperfect, let us think rather of ſuppreſſing then defending them; of correcting our Faults rather then excuſing them: And let us not expect from our Eloquence what was ſpoken but in jeſt concerning that of the famous <hi>Pirocles,</hi> who, when he was worſted in Wreſtling, perſwaded the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctators he had no fall, and conſtrain'd them to give more credit to his Speeches than to their own eyes. If it be ſo hard to know our ſelves aright, how much more difficult is it to ſpeak of our ſelves as we ought? In which caſe, tho we think as we ought, we ought not always to ſpeak of our ſelves as we think, Where open and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd Vanity is inſupportable, exceſſive Humility al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſuſpected of conceal'd Vanity, and the way between
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:62940:3"/>theſe ſo narrow and ſo hard to keep, that I know not for what reaſon, or rather through what error, ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny without any neceſſity imbark upon a Sea ſo full of Rocks, and famous for ſo many Shipwracks,</p>
            <p>But we fear nothing of this, when we labour for a Friend that is no more. It becomes us to defend with heat the Fame and Praiſes which concern us not, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe Faults we have not committed, and to ſpeak for him who cannot defend himſelf. Paſſion and tranſport ſhow handſome here; and though we ſtretch the Truth a little, and of a great make an extraordinary man, thoſe who condem our Jugement will eſteem our Affection, and wiſh to have Friends like us. Let us add one voice then to the noiſe of his Praiſes, yea begin amongſt the People, and in the crow'd of his Admirers theſe firſt Applauſes, which in all likelyhood will be ſeconded by thoſe of all <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Works have not been collected without much pains, and doubtleſs would have appear'd handſomer, if he had had the advantage to publiſh them himſelf: And we muſt acknowledge that there is I know not what of a laſt hand, which cannot be given to the Works of the mind but by thoſe that made them. We dare not handle the Writings of a dead Friend as we would our own; either through a reſpect we bear the <hi>Genius</hi> of another, or a diſtruſt of our own, or fear by confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing two different ways of producing a bad one; and the more Judgment we have, the leſs Boldneſs. I aſſure my ſelf notwithſtanding, that theſe Orphans, unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate as they are in the untimely loſs of their Father, will have the good Fortune to pleaſe their Country, that a ſmall number of Defects ſhall be hid under the brightneſs and light of a great number of Beauties; that if any one will attain them, he ſhall labour only for their glory; and if they muſt fight, it will be only in order to tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph.</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:62940:4"/>
            <p>Amongſt the divers Pieces whereof this Volume is compoſed, the <hi>Hiſtory of the Siege of Dunkirk</hi> preſents it ſelf firſt, which having already ſeen the Light, and gain'd the publique Approbation, ſeems to refuſe my Praiſes, and ſend them to ſome of its Fellows; however let me ſay to thoſe that knew Monſieur <hi>Saraſin</hi> but by halves, and only by his Poems, That 'tis the Work of a Maſterly hand that never abandoned Judgment to run after Wit, and ſought not Flowers when 'twas the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Fruits: So that writing the Hiſtory of a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Action, which held much of bare Relation, he hath contain'd his ſtyle within a juſt mediocrity, not ſuffering it to raiſe it ſelf too ambitiouſly above its ſubject, and hath deſerv'd extream praiſe in that way wherein he ſeem'd not to have ſought it.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Walſtenis</hi>'s Conſpiracy which follows, as it ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs'd this Hiſtory for the richneſs of the matter, had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely ſurpaſs'd it for the beauty of the workmanſhip, if the Deſtiny of human things, which ſeems every where to deny perfection, had permitted Monſieur <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſin</hi> to finiſh ſo excellent a Piece. However, if Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity thought fit to rank with Maſter-pieces ſome Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures left imperfect, yea ſome Lines drawn upon an empty Cloth; why ſhould not we render the ſame Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice to this Fragment and its Author? He hath not done enough for us; but be hath done enough for himſelf, and to let us ſee that if he had lived a little longer he had got the Reputation of an Excellent Hiſtorian.</p>
            <p>In theſe two words I pretend to have included a thouſand praiſes, and repreſented a thouſand great and rare qualities. Not to ſpeak of that which depends in ſome ſort on our Will or on Fortune, to be well inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and to be faithful; not to imploy our Pains and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, whether innocently or on deſign, to abuſe Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; a good Hiſtorian beſides this ought to have an U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal Knowledge of the World, and of Affairs; a
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:62940:4"/>mind ſubtil and penetrating, capable of unraveling the true Cauſes of human Actions from their pretexts and colours; an Imagination lively and judicious together, apprehending things as they are, and afterwards deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering them ſo as he hath conceived them: he doth not recount, he paints; and if he ſpeaks of a Battel, a Negotiation, the Paſſions of Princes or their Miniſters, his Readers think they fight or negotiate, are agitated with the ſame Deſires, the ſame Inquietudes. He hath beſides an exquiſite taſte in all that may pleaſe or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe, weary or entertain; and though he omits nothing neceſſary, he knows to extend or ſhut up his ſeveral ſubjects according as the beauty of his Work requires. He doth not ſhow his Wit, but lets it be ſeen every where; he lies not in ambuſh on all paſſages to ſpeak fine things, and apply Sentences of <hi>Seneca;</hi> he expreſſes ſometimes a weighty matter in a word, or cauſes it to be underſtood without ſpeaking it, as thoſe that with the ſole motion of their eye tacitly approve or condemn what is ſaid or done in their preſence. His ſtyle is clear, ſimple, familiar, but without lowneſs, and accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every where with dignity; for he ſtill remembers that he entertains all Nations and all Ages, that all the Earth hears him, that he ſpeaks, as we may ſay, in the publique Aſſembly of Mankind, where nothing ought to ſcape him which is not mingled with a Character of ſhamefac'dneſs, reſpect, and good manners. But that I be not accuſed to extend my ſelf too far on this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, all theſe great things whereof I have ſpoken, are found in this Fragment: I have drawn the true <hi>Genius</hi> of an Hiſtorian, but have done it only by copying it from this Work.</p>
            <p>After theſe two Hiſtories we have put the Dialogue upon the Queſtion, <hi>If a young man ought to be Amor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</hi> Thoſe who are not favourable to our Author will, I confeſs, find here ſomething to object, and ſo oblige
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62940:5"/>me to imploy the more pains to defend it. This kind of writing hath been hitherto little us'd by the <hi>French;</hi> Whether they have thought it hard to attain its perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; or whether a Nation quick and impatient, as ours, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not intirely reliſh Works, where much time is loſt before we can arrive at the Subject, or find what we ſeek: Whence perhaps it is, that Dialogues have no where been in ſo much eſteem as with <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Italians,</hi> men of great wits and great leaſure. For my part, to ſpeak my mind, I think the leſs Dialogues are in uſe with us, the more honour 'twould be to bring them into publique liking, even againſt the inclination of the Age; which would infallibly come to paſs, if we us'd all that Art and Wit they require. There ſeems to be three kinds of them, the character and uſe of each is different. The firſt are thoſe we may properly call Didacticks, whoſe only end it is to inſtruct, and are contented with adding to ſolidity of Doctrine clearneſs and elegancie of Expreſſion; they are chiefly uſeful in this, That repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting to the life the doubts of an ingenious Scholar and the deciſions of a learned Maſter, they ſhow by the order of Queſtions and Anſwers, the order of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges and the progreſs of Reaſon; and that more neat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and in a way more lively and animated than a bare diſcourſe could do. The ſecond kind is oppos'd to this, and we may rank here Dialogues of raillery, which take only the flower of things, inſtruct by laughing, and go not to profit but by pleaſure: They have their value too; and their ingenious, ſubtil, fine and delicate ſtrokes deſcend ſometimes deeper into our minds than the moſt grave and ſerious Precepts. But between theſe two there is a third kind, and may be eſteem'd the perfecteſt, which not having all the auſterities of the firſt, nor all the ſportiveneſs of the ſecond, holds ſomething of each of them; for it handles ſolid matters, and handles them ſolidly, but brings a thouſand kinds of Ornament to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62940:5"/>render them more acceptable. The Dialogue of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>Saraſin</hi> is of this laſt kind, in which three things are neceſſary to its perfection; the choice of the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, knowledge and profound meditation of this Matter, and the Art of reducing it to Dialogue. The Matter ought to be ſome Science or ſome Art, but thoſe Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences and Arts which fall oftneſt into Converſation, and do not wound the mind by their thornyneſs: Law mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, for Example, cannot be proper, leſs Geometry or Algebra; the great Waters we ought to drink of are, Morality, Politiques, Rhetorick and Poeſie. Next follows a profound meditation of the Subject, either diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering ſomething in it which hath not been by others touch'd at, or ſomething new upon the common places of others; which (in my Opinion) is the greateſt and moſt noble proof of human Wit: For what can be more excellent than to teach men by new ways thoſe general Maxims whence ſprings their happineſs; to add, as I may ſay, new rays, new brightneſs to thoſe great and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Lights which guide the whole courſe of our life. In the laſt place, he muſt have the Art of Dialogue, that this Converſation he repreſents, though more learned and ſerious than ordinary ones be, yet a converſation, that is, a free, familiar, and natural entertainment ſtrow'd every where with mirth and gaiety, and the civilities of honeſt men. The Dialogues of <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Zenophon</hi> do not only inſtruct us by the Diſcourſe of their <hi>Socrates,</hi> but make us wiſh we had liv'd with him, and had ſeen with our eyes, I ſay not this Philoſopher, but this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and animated Philoſophy, ſo ſublime and ſo hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſo divine and ſo human at once. And that inimitable Dialogue which <hi>Cicero</hi> hath left us, does not only teach us the Rhetorick of the World and of Affairs, differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent from that of the Colledge; but alſo ſhows us all the graces of <hi>Roman</hi> Converſation, and that Urbanity which our words of civility, gallantry, and politeneſs explain
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:62940:6"/>imperfectly, and which our Language hath not found a proper name for. To come now to our Author, of thoſe three parts, which make up the perfection of a Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, there are two wherein, if I do not deceive my ſelf, we cannot reproach him: his Matter is a queſtion of Morality not only handled, but cannot chooſe but be handled in ordinary Converſations: and for that Art of ſpeaking things with the familiarity and liberty of a true converſation, it appears throughout; he hath followed the track of the Antients, and happily profited himſelf of their great Examples. There reſts only to examine the things he hath us'd with this Art; and here all that is oppos'd is, that there is too little his own; that there is leſs Wit than Reading; more Memory than Invention. And certainly he himſelf knew, that having had divers occaſions to ſhow his Wit, this of introducing learned men ſeem'd favourable for him to diſplay and pour out thoſe rich Harveſts he had made in the beſt Books of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Languages, and acknowledg'd he was carried to a deſire of doing it with ſome exceſs, and was not the maſter of it. But his Dialogue, according to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, ſhould have had two parts; and as in this he had given leſs to Reaſonings than to Authorities and Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, ſo he propos'd the contrary in the other. Beſides, if we conſider well, when a man is acknowledg'd Maſter of a Wit, great, noble, and fertil, and reproach'd to have taken from others what he might have found in himſelf, preferring the riches of ſtrangers to his own: This Reproach, I ſay, carries with it praiſe as well as blame. I would he had done better: But ſhall it ſtand for nothing that he hath done well? Becauſe he hath not deſerv'd all our praiſes, ſhall we refuſe him thoſe he hath deſerv'd? Should we not imitate <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Hero, who at the Sports he celebrated in honour of his Father, after he had given the firſt prize to the Vanquiſher, gave two others, ſometimes three, to thoſe that came neareſt to Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory?</p>
            <pb n="9" facs="tcp:62940:6"/>
            <p>That we may the better comprehend what glory our Author merits by his Poems, let us make here a general reflection, which perhaps will be neither unpleaſant nor unprofitable. Amongſt thoſe Reaſons which cauſe us attribute to Poetry I know not what of Divinity, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks I ſee two which are not the leaſt important.</p>
            <p>Firſt, which indeed carries with it ſomething great and marvellous, that in a Langunge ſo conſtrain'd as this, they can expreſs thoughts the moſt ſubtil and the moſt delicate, high and ſublime, with ſo much liberty. What Prodigy is this? when we ſpeak in Proſe, and all terms and all expreſſions of a Language are abandon'd to us, if ſome thought comes into our mind which is not common, we have difficulty to make it be underſtood, and often our words remain below our matter: whilſt theſe men who ſeem truly inſpir'd, after they have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd on themſelves a neceſſity of uſing only certain fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhions of ſpeaking, and deſpiſing all the reſt as too vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar; to ſhut up their words in a certain meaſure, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways like it ſelf; add, if you pleaſe, to end always by Ryme; after, I ſay, they have ſubmitted to ſo many hard Laws, and difficult to be obſerv'd, in ſpite of all theſe obſtacles they make us underſtand all that they pleaſe, in a way more noble and more eaſie, than 'tis poſſible to do in common Diſcourſe. One would think they could not ſay what they ſay otherways, though they would, ſo eaſie are their expreſſions; their words drop from their Pen without deſign, and each naturally takes it place: The Harp of <hi>Amphion</hi> did no greater miracle, when the Stones drawn by its harmony rank't themſelves one by another to build the famous Walls of <hi>Thebes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But in the ſecond place, Poetry may be eſteem'd Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine in regard of its Subject, which ſhe draws from her ſelf; whereas Proſe borrows it elſewhere, and doth only beautifie and poliſh it. When we conſider a Houſe of Pleaſure in the hands of powerful and cutious Maſter,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:62940:7"/>and ſee Mountains level'd to pleaſe him; Precipices fil'd up; Rivers turn'd out of their way; Springs, before hid under ground, ſport it in the air; we admire mans induſtry, and cannot enough wonder that a Creature ſo weak in appearance ſhould be capable of ſo great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns: But if it ſhould happen that in this vaſt extent of Air, where before was nothing to arreſt our ſight, we ſhould diſcover in an inſtant a proud and magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Palace, ſpatious Fields, Mountains, Foreſts, Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers and Seas, we ſhould inſtantly cry out, That 'twas not the effect of any Human power, but ſomething a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove our Nature. 'Tis much the ſame in Poeſie and Proſe; the one, as I ſaid, takes its Subject elſewhere, changes it, embelliſhes it, 'tis true, beyond all we could expect; but the other asks nothing of any body, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with it ſelf, draws all its Matter from its own bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, making of nothing ſomething, by a kind of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation which ſeems to ſurpaſs Human power. Thus we may ſay that two things render Poetry admirable, the Invention, whence it hath its name; and the Facility, which is very neceſſary to it. I do not ſpeak of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility of compoſing, which may ſometimes be happy, but ought always to be ſuſpected; I mean the Facility that the Reader finds in the Compoſition, which is often to the Writer one of the moſt difficult things in the World, and may be compar'd to Terraſs Gardens, whereof the expence is hid, and after they have coſt thouſands, ſeem only the work of Chance or Nature. He that doth not find in himſelf nor richneſs of Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor this happy Eaſineſs, let him not knock at the Muſes Gate, for it is not neceſſary we make Verſes. Now we ſhould be unjuſt, not to acknowledge that they both meet in Monſieur <hi>Saraſin.</hi> As for Invention, he hath always ſomething ingenious, new, and particular, which he hath not taken elſewhere, and which he owes only to himſelf: And for Facility, where is it to be
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:62940:7"/>found if not in his Works? never any thing was wrote more free, more eaſie, and more ſliding: Nature not only appears every where, but, as a famous man ſaid, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears every where at her eaſe.</p>
            <p>I perceive I am gone farr, but how can I but ſay ſomething of thoſe ſeveral ſorts of things of different nature, wherein this great man took pleaſure to exerciſe himſelf? To excel in one kind of writing is much; to excel in many, and almoſt oppos'd, as Monſieur <hi>Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin</hi> did, is a certain mark of the greatneſs and beauty of a <hi>Genius.</hi> I will go further; 'twas once ſaid, That an eloquent man had the ſame advantage over other men, that other men had over beaſts. We can make without injuſtice almoſt the ſame compariſon between him that is not able but for one ſort of writing, and he that is excellent in many. For certainly, by what name ſoever we ought to call that Light which conducts Beaſts, it produces ſo admirable effects, that our Reaſon, as proud as ſhe is, is forc'd into wonder and acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that ſhe knows not how to attain the like: But notwithſtanding, becauſe this Light which directs them ſo divinely in ſome things, wholly leaves them in others, and there remains not one ray, one ſpark of it, we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire what they ſo marvellouſly operate, but we eſteem them much below our ſelves; judging that this princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which often makes them act ſo well, hath ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the ſtranger in it; greater, 'tis true, than our Reaſon, but is not to them what our Reaſon is to us; that 'tis rather lent than given them; that it makes them go to their end without their knowledge, as an Arrow that flies to the Mark which it ſees not, guided by the eye, and forc'd by the hand of the Archer: Whereas Man, as he hath for the things of the body an univerſal Inſtrument, which is the Hand, hath alſo for the things of the mind an univerſal Inſtrument, that is, Reaſon, which he imploys continually in all ſorts of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:62940:8"/>occaſions and to all purpoſes; whoſe extent, rather than force, diſtinguiſhes it from that other and inferiour kind. By a like conſequence when we ſee one excel in one kind of work, and not fit for any other, if we ſpeak the truth, in what he doth ſo well, we admire rather Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in him than admire him: For we conclude, That if he doth not act by chance, at leaſt he acts by a blind Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, and only by Imagination, which is that part in us, we have common with beaſts. But that which ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhes all our eſteem and all our admiration is, to ſee one that acting by this general and univerſal principle, and poſſeſſing the Idea of ſeveral kinds of writing, paſſes from one to another with extream facility: As an able Printer, who having all his Characters before him, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh'd in their ſeveral Cells, chooſes without heſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and without miſtake, the great, the ſmall, the leaſt, according as the beauty of his own Work de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. Whatever a Wit of this make goes about, he ſeems to have apply'd himſelf always and altogether to that thing; the <hi>Proteus</hi> of the Fables, nor the concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Naturaliſts, change not more eaſily than he. He will be like that Philoſophy expreſſed in <hi>Boetius,</hi> ſometimes of the ordinary ſtature of a man, ſometimes his head rais'd to the Clouds. He will imitate the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleneſs of <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> who was at <hi>Sparta</hi> more labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and more auſtere than a <hi>Lacedemonian;</hi> in <hi>Ionica</hi> more voluptuous than the <hi>Ionians;</hi> in <hi>Perſia</hi> more pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous and magnificent than the <hi>Perſians,</hi> changing man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners as Climates and abode. His light will be as that of the Sun, which Philoſophers ſay is of no colour, nor in it ſelf a colour, but becomes any colour accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the object that receives it. He will accord things ſerious and witty; Verſe ſhall not hinder him to write well in Proſe. Such are the Wits of the firſt Magnitude, and ſuch will appear the <hi>Genius</hi> of Monſieur <hi>Saraſin</hi> in this Volume.</p>
            <pb n="13" facs="tcp:62940:8"/>
            <p>But now having given him theſe Praiſes, let us an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to what may be ſaid in general againſt his Works. It is not my deſign here to reply to all that Envy or Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance can oppoſe: Now adaies, that men boldly tear in piceces the moſt famous Authors living, who will wonder, if they treat the Dead after the ſame manner? There is not a more agreeable Conſort, ſaith a Greek Poet, than that of two men, whereof one ſpeaks all manner of Ill, and the other hears him without Anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; let our Age have the pleaſure of this ſweet muſick without interruption, either in behalf of the Living, or the Dead. I ſhall only ſpeak to three ſorts of perſons, that act on a better ſcore, and whoſe Objections are moſt important.</p>
            <p>The Firſt are they, who would paſs their Melancholy for Solidity and Vertue; and knowing that our Author hath been chiefly celebrated for his Works that are purely divertiſing, they refuſe his Writings even with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reading them, and accuſe him for employing his Pen about things unprofitable. Theſe ſevere Judges, more wiſe than God and Nature, who have made an infinite number of things for the meer pleaſure of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, would have men labour continually in Law, Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick and Divinity; telling us, That nothing deſerves e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem, but what tends to publick benefit. In this laſt particular I am near to their opinion; but I cannot believe we labour unprofitably, when we labour agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably for the greateſt part of the World, and when with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out corrupting mens minds, we can divert and pleaſe them. Shall we call thoſe unprofitable Works, whereby the Maſter of a Family eaſes himſelf of his Domeſtick toils; the Prince and Miniſter of their cares of State, a Magiſtrate of the tumult and noiſe of Courts; a Souldier of his pains, and the Artizan of his labour? that make one forget for a time, his poverty; another his diſeaſe; a third his cruel paſſions, and all in general
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:62940:9"/>their misfortunes? Thoſe that judge ſo are groſsly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and take the means for the end, for want of going far enough, and penetrating to the bottom of things. Let us open our eyes, and let us not imagine that either the Exchange, deſtin'd to Commerce; or the Schools, where they teach and diſpute eternally; or the Barr, where they plead particular Cauſes; or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, where they deliberate of publick affairs; or theſe Armies, or theſe Canons, or in a word, theſe great number of Engines, which move the vaſt body of the State, are things made for themſelves, or have every one a particular end: they have all one general end, which is, that the Citizens may live together vertuouſly, peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, and pleaſantly. Theſe three things have, or ought to have met in the intention of Law-makers, and thoſe that have founded Republiques: All that which contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes to the laſt without hurting the other two, far from being out of the way to publick good, as it may ſeem, take a more direct and ſhorter way thither: For example, The Writings of one well skill'd in the Law are profitable, who denies it? they inſtruct the Lawyer to defend his Cauſe; and the Lawyer well inſtructed, the Judge pronounces Sentence aright; the Judge doing Juſtice, the Citizens live in peace: but we often ſee, that the ſeveral hands of ſo many divers Artizans turn the Art from its natural intention; and it happens here as in thoſe Machines, fair and of good invention in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance; but being compos'd of many pieces, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſome one is alwaies out of order, they are often uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and ſometimes overturn what they ſhould bear. On the contrary, theſe other Writings, which treat commonly of Trifles, if they do not ſerve to regulate the manners, or to enlighten the mind, as they may, as they ought and as ordinarily they do, directly or indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly; at leaſt without having need of any thing, but themſelves, they pleaſe, they divert, they ſow and ſcatter
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:62940:9"/>every where chearfulneſs, which is after vertue the chiefeſt good. The man you blame finds perhaps, that to re-eſtabliſh his ruin'd health, to defend himſelf from evil fortune, for the good of the Family whereof he is the ſtay, it is more profitable for him to make Songs, than to write of Morality and Politicks; if ſo, we may boldly affirm, that Morality and Politicks bid him make Songs; and 'tis an injuſtice without example to condemn what another does, without knowing the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives or the circumſtances. But I go too far, and M. <hi>Saraſin</hi> hath no need of this defence; for we ſee by the different pieces of this Volume, that he reach'd at Fame by different waies, that he thought of great things as well as ſmall, if any part of learning can be call'd ſmall.</p>
            <p>'Tis better that I now turn my ſelf to thoſe that are reconciled to the truth I apply to this kind of compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, but will not pardon the leaſt fault in it; belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving perhaps by their ſevere Criticiſms to gain the repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of men more quick-fighted than others. They are deceiv'd; and if there be no malignity in what they think, deſerve to be diſabus'd merrily, which I ſhall eſſay to do. I knew an an ancient Gentleman, a great Wit and a great Courtier; Age ſeem'd to have reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renc'd theſe two rare qualities in him, and only to have attempted on his body; his ſight began to weaken in ſuch a manner, that he ſaw nothing but with difficulty; yet ſtill he us'd an extraordinary diligence, not to cure this imperfection which he knew incurable, but to hide it even from his moſt intimate acquaintance: and if at any time he chanc'd to be at liberty with them, he would ſtrive by all means to diſcover either ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable ſpot upon their Clothes, or a Ribband out of its place, or ſomething of this nature; and when he had given them this proof of his ſight, return'd with leſs regret to his firſt obſcurity, and contented himſelf
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:62940:10"/>with that troubled and confuſed light which Age had left him. Is it not by a like Artifice, that ſo many, little or meanly Learned, excuſe nothing in producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Brain, and pretend that they are not able to ſupport the leaſt negligences? for, in a word, thoſe that pardon theſe ſmall defects in an excellent work, ſee them it may be better than thoſe that will not. If there be any difference, 'tis, that they perceive the beauties much better, which are more ſenſible. A good Wit embraces them, as we may ſay, with his Love; all that is in them pleaſe, becauſe they find a great number of things worthy to pleaſe. If it be told us, that this is a diſcaſe of the mind, 'tis at worſt one of thoſe diſeaſes which are the ſigns of health, whereof <hi>Hippocrates</hi> makes mention, and amongſt them reckons Hunger and Thirſt, though they are two things purely Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral.</p>
            <p>It may be I am preoccupied with a like paſſion for the Works of my Friend; however, in the laſt place, I cannot be friends with an Opinion which ſome others have taken up, and which I ſhould have conceal'd, if their Diſcourſes had not made it publick. But I muſt ſay, that I approach this point with trembling, for I ſee, or fear I ſee amongſt thoſe I am to combat, ſome whom I reverence, and whoſe Opinions are any where elſe ſo many Laws to me. For all this let us boldly ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture either to defend the Truth, if we are happy enough to know it, or let the World ſee that we are deceiv'd, as it often happens to men from the leaſt to the greateſt. In one word, I would defend our Author, not from the Admirers of the deceaſed <hi>Voiture,</hi> for I am one of them; but from thoſe that will admire none but him; who hold him for the only Original of brave things; and fear not to ſay, or ſuffer it to be underſtood, that all the reſt, and in particular M. <hi>Saraſin,</hi> are but bad Imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors or mean Copieſts. I ſay again, none admires <hi>Voiture</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:62940:10"/>more than my ſelf; not excepting this excellent man, who being too unjuſtly condemn'd to an eternal ſilence, when he heard ſome attack the Memory of his Friend, burſt like the Son of <hi>Croeſus,</hi> all the ſtrings of his Tongue, and cried out (but, good God, with what a grace, and with what force?) <hi>It is the King.</hi> Only that I may be the Echo of this voice, I willingly repeat <hi>It is the King,</hi> and diſpute not to <hi>Voiture</hi> the firſt place in many things, without examining whether he deſerves it in all. But certainly the field of Fame is wide enough for all the World; there is more than one Lawrel and one Crown upon <hi>Parnaſſus.</hi> Can we not enough eſteem <hi>Voiture</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out deſpiſing thoſe that he himſelf eſteem'd? let him e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver enjoy the advantage to have been of the beſt and moſt gallant Society that ever was, from which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd much, and to which he contributed much; let him charm eternally all the choice Spirits of the World; let him be eternally inimitable; but let them not eternally accuſe us for imitating him, and for being of the number of thoſe men, or to ſpeak with <hi>Horace,</hi> thoſe Beaſts given to ſervitude, who have, or ſo little Courage, that they dare not undertake any thing of themſelves, or ſo much Raſhneſs, that they pretend alwaies to do better than thoſe that went before them. For my part I am of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that a man who hath a Genius high and noble, as M. <hi>Saraſin,</hi> will endeavour to equal all the Writers of his Age, but will not imitate one of them. However, let us ſee in what part of his Works he could be an Imitator of thoſe of other mens. Is it in the Hiſtory of the ſiege of <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> in <hi>Walſtein</hi>'s Conſpiracy? this I think is not that they would ſay. Is it in his Dialogue, in his Funeral pomp, &amp;c? there is little likelyhood here neither. Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage then, we have ſav'd half this Volume. <hi>Voiture</hi> wrote a great number of excellent Letters, and if we may judge by the pleaſure they give, 'tis this part of his Works he lov'd and eſteem'd moſt. M. <hi>Saraſin</hi> on the contrary
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:62940:11"/>hath ſcarce wrote any thing of this kind with care; and when he was oblig'd by ſome reaſon of neceſſity or good manners, he apply'd himſelf to it with regret and diſcontent, for he could not endure that, when a man had got the reputation of Writing well, he ſhould loſe the liberty of writing as other men do; I have ſeen one of his Letters wherein he complains very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly of it, and theſe words remain with my memory, <hi>I envy the happineſs of my Lawyer, who begins all his Letters with,</hi> I have received yours, <hi>and no body finds fault with him.</hi> Not but that ſometimes ſome Letters ſcap'd him of an excellent and particular Character; but he keeping no Copy of them, the moſt are loſt by the regligence of his Friends, and we have found only four or five, which we have not been willing to publiſh, leſt it ſhould be thought that they were the beſt of a great many, and that by chooſing them we condemn'd the reſt.</p>
            <p>I can pronounce then, that in all theſe two wrote in Proſe there is ſo little reſemblance, that one of them doth not give us the leaſt occaſion to think of the other. Let us come then to the Poetry, where I confeſs we ſhall have a task of it: And yet here we have a great advantage, for they cannot reproach us with the imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any particular Poem. <hi>But,</hi> ſay they, <hi>you have imitated the chief, that is, the Style and Character; and that kind of Poetry</hi> Voiture <hi>had introduc'd, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing Gravity without ſtooping to Buffonry, is moſt proper to entertain the ingenious part of the World.</hi> To anſwer this Objection 'tis neceſſary to begin a little fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther off.</p>
            <p>It hath been ſaid, that Sciences travel through the World; and as they owe their light to all the Earth, after they have a long time ſhin'd on one Climate, they leave it in its firſt darkneſs to go and diſſipate that of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. To this we may add, That in all Climates,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:62940:11"/>and amongſt every Nation, every Art and Science takes it turn, as we may ſay, to loſe its ball upon this great Theater, and then retires to give place to another. Whether this variety proceeds only from the deſtiny of humane things, alwaies ſubject to change; or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther 'tis bred from the diverſity of times, or the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent genius of thoſe who govern, whoſe Inclinations ſerve for Laws. Now theſe revolutions, as thoſe of Commonwealths, are made by means of ſome reigning Wit, elevated above the reſt, who not contented with the preſent ſtate of things, finds out a new way to greatneſs and glory: But as ſoon as one of theſe extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Wits appear, we ſee two other ſorts which ſet out alſo; the firſt, who have nothing good, but a Wit to do well, follow the track, but afar off, and are only ſhadows and vain images, imitating him to little pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; forgetting that there is no vertue, but hath two vices attending it, nor elevation, which is not environ'd with precipices. The other doth not 'tis true take a contrary way, for then they ſhould oppoſe the guſt of the Age, which greedily embraces the novelty, and perhaps they ſhould oppoſe their own Inclination, which had carried them to the ſame thing, if they had not been prevented; but going the ſame way they open different paths, make new diſcoveries, ſometimes they overtake, ſometimes they paſs him that was before them; and if they do nor the one nor the other, they make a different Character that hath its price and its proper va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue. 'Twould be eaſie for me to juſtifie what I have ſaid by Examples of moſt Nations, if that tediouſneſs, which without doubt hath wearied my Reader, had not wearied me too. To come then to our particular Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, <hi>French</hi> Poetry was gay and fooling in the time of <hi>Marot</hi> and <hi>Melin;</hi> and though ſince it hath ſometimes appear'd with the ſame face, yet <hi>Ronſard, Bellay, Perron,</hi> more grave and ſerious, had refin'd it, and our Muſes
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:62940:12"/>began to be as ſevere as the Philoſopher of Antiquity, who never was ſeen to laugh. <hi>Voiture,</hi> who can refuſe him this praiſe? comes next with a Wit gallant and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate, a Melancholy ſweet and ingenious; he call'd to mind the liberty of our Ancient Poetry, and had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his eyes that of the <hi>Italians,</hi> and the moſt polite <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> Authors; of all theſe together, not following any, he compos'd a kind of Writing, which charms no leſs by its graces, than by its novelty. What ſhould M. <hi>Saraſin</hi> do, who came into the World a little after him? if his inclination had led him from this kind of writing, I aſſure my ſelf he would have forc'd it to accommodate with the time; but I think the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, and that he gave thanks to Fortune for being born in an Age whoſe taſte was ſo conform to his own, and which 'twas ſo eaſie for him to ſatisfie. He began then to write in this free ſtyle, and finding himſelf rich in his own Inventions, no more imitated <hi>Voiture,</hi> than <hi>Voiture</hi> did <hi>Marott.</hi> Now it theſe ingenious and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed perſons will confound theſe two ſo different manners of Writing, they wrong themſelves; and ſhould leave it to weak and obſcure ſights, to make no diſtinction between things that only have ſome reſemblance. Take a man altogether ignorant, he will put all the Poets in the World in one rank, from <hi>Virgil</hi> to the makers of Acroſticks. Give him a little light, and he will diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh between Heroick-Poem, Satyre, Epigram and Elegy; but will not be able to make any difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Statius</hi> and <hi>Virgil; Plautus</hi> and <hi>Terence; Juvenel</hi> and <hi>Horace; Martial</hi> and <hi>Catullus:</hi> and for <hi>Ovid, Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bullus</hi> and <hi>Propertius,</hi> he will not ſuſpect 'tis poſſible to diſtinguiſh their Genius and Character. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, he that hath an exquiſite taſte, and an exact knowledge of good Authors, will not only diſtinguiſh the Characters of theſe ſeveral Writers, but, as all things have their abuſe and exceſs, he will ſin on the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:62940:12"/>other hand, and miſtruſt the teſtimony of Books and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſcripts; and finding in Works of the ſame Author ſome light difference of Style, he will attribute them to divers Authors; without conſidering that a man is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times as different from himſelf, as he is from another man.</p>
            <p>If our Nation and our Age cannot produce in every kind, more than one man for our admiration; if <hi>Voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> hath left nothing for others to do, unhappy they that follow him, let them renounce Poetry; why ſhould they engage in a buſineſs wherein there is no more Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to pretend to? but let us not ſo cruelly diſcourage ſo many brave perſons that run the ſame career. I know ſome (and how many are there which I know not?) whoſe Writings, though in the ſame kind, will paſs one day, I believe, for Originals and not for Copies. One, with the Spirit of the World and of the Court, will have ſomething of fine, ſubtle, labour'd, turn'd, united; another will inſpire his works with the Spirit of Love, and ſome tender and delicate paſſion not to be found elſewhere; a third tho Sportingly, will have the art to ſtrow his Writings with the moſt excellent Morality; and who can recount the ſeveral Characters which are now to be found, or may appear hereafter in theſe things, ſeeing that from the divers mixture of theſe qualities, as from ſo many Elements, an infinity of forms and different ſpecies may ariſe?</p>
            <p>Let us try if we can clear this by a Compariſon. There is ſomething happens like this in all good Arts; there is no one of them which hath not been cultivated by a certain number of excellent men; ſome have gone before, others have followed, and every one hath contributed ſomething of his own to the perfection of the Art, ſo that we do not find the entire Art in one, but in all taken together. Let us conſider the progreſs of Painting, which hath ſo much affinity with Poetry. Amongſt the Illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Painters of Greece <hi>Apollodorus</hi> was the moſt ancient;
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:62940:13"/>but they ſaid of him, that he only open'd the Doors of the Art, whereas <hi>Zeuxes</hi> was the firſt that enter'd by a more exact imitation of Nature. After him follows that crowd of famous Painters, <hi>Paraſius, Protogenes, Pamphilus, Ariſtedes, Nichomachus,</hi> and ſeveral others, every one happy in certain things, which <hi>Pliny</hi> hath ſo exactly and pleaſantly deſcrib'd, one excell'd in Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry, another in the Invention and deſign; this was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem'd for well repreſenting the Hair and extremities of the body, that for hitting the Paſſions and Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of men; another for admirably finiſhing his works; and ſome for ending in a ſhort time. <hi>Appelles</hi> ſurpaſs'd every one for a certain inimitable grace, which he beſtow'd on all that paſt his hands; but this <hi>Appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,</hi> this Great <hi>Appelles,</hi> as eminent for his Wit as for his Penſil, freely gave way to <hi>Amphion</hi> for order, and to <hi>Aſclepiodorus</hi> for heightnings and due obſervance of diſtances. Let us on in this path, for 'tis all ſtrow'd with flowers; and we cannot go amiſs though we are out of the way; for we now diſcourſe of thoſe Painters whoſe Fame is fixt in books, and whoſe Names had been e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fac'd as their Colours, if the Works of Learned Pens did not laſt longer than thoſe of the beſt Pencils. <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phael</hi> being the Diſciple of <hi>Pietro Perugino,</hi> at firſt follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Maſter by an imitation exact, and labour'd, as they ſay, but dry, and imitated his manner ſo preciſely, that what the one and the other did could not be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh'd: but his Genius beyond compare greater than that of his Maſter, could not long be contain'd in the ſame bounds; he fortified it by the imitation of <hi>Leonard</hi> and <hi>Michael Angelo,</hi> and added Graces that theſe two excellent men, though conſummate in the Art, never knew, he compos'd a new and charming way, infinitely beyond thoſe he had followed. <hi>Julius Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main,</hi> the Scholar of <hi>Raphael,</hi> had a great Spirit, and was capable of the greateſt deſigns and moſt noble ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priccios
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:62940:13"/>of the Art, but wanted the ſweetneſs and graces of his Maſter, though he had labour'd all his life to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit himſelf of his Precepts and Examples; all his Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures were fierce and bold, and he diſcover'd how our reſolution in vain carries us one way, when Nature draws or leads us another. <hi>Jitian</hi> on the contrary had an ordinary Painter for his Maſter, yet notwithſtanding he ſurpaſſes all his Profeſſion in the ſweet mixture of his Colours, and in that love which reigns in all his pieces. <hi>Correggio</hi> ow'd leſs to others inſtructions, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture form'd him her ſelf, he was born and bred in Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, never imitated any, and yet by an admirable effect of his great Genius, his pieces have an univerſal way. which holds ſomething of all the reſt. Let us admire this diverſity: One by far ſurpaſſes all thoſe he imitates; another, though eminent in ſeveral things of his own, us'd all his skill to reſemble others, and could not attain it; this, though he perfectly knew what all their ſeveral waies had in them of excellent, yet could not form a better; that knew it not, nor imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated any one, and one would ſay he had taken them all together. They followed one another, and inſtructed one another, and yet are all great Maſters and not Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieſts.</p>
            <p>But why do we ſtay upon Compariſons, perhaps too far from our Subject, when we have ſuch as are near at hand? Every one knows how much our Language owes to the admirable Wit of the deceaſed <hi>Balſac;</hi> nor can we diſſemble it without too much ingratitude, it was not the ſame after he began to Write, but changed face and came about. All thoſe that wrote after him are his Debters for part of their Style: even thoſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt abuſed people, who when they ſay, to ſpeak <hi>Balſac</hi> mean, to ſpeak ill, if ever they ſpeak handſomly, are oblig'd without knowing it, to him whom they outrage and abuſe. The Fame of this excellant man will be
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:62940:14"/>without doubt great and immortal; yet not ſuch as to obſcure that of many illuſtrious Writers, who appeared after him; nor in particular that of <hi>Voiture,</hi> who yet is as much his Debtor for expreſſion, as M. <hi>Saraſin</hi> is to <hi>Voiture</hi> for the Character of his Verſe. To end this; <hi>Voiture,</hi> if we will believe his intimate Friends, was of very delightful Converſation, ſo was M. <hi>Saraſin;</hi> but 'twas, as all agree, in a different way; if Diſcourſe and Writings are equally the images of the mind, why might not the like different Graces, which appear'd in their Converſe, be found alſo in their Works?</p>
            <p>After having beſtow'd ſo many Praiſes on M. <hi>Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin</hi>'s Works, let us a while ſpeak of M. <hi>Saraſin</hi> himſelf. I know not by what ill fortune, the genius of Letters, and the genius for the World, are almoſt incompatible; thoſe who conſecrate themſelves to ſtudy, are capable of little elſe but ſtudying; the moſt part of them ſeem not to live but in their Works; to be Authors they ceaſe almoſt to be men; they have their minds full of great knowledges, but when they would draw ſome preſent profit from them, they let us ſee how great a diſtance there is between the beauty of contemplation, and the vigour of action and practice; like that famous Gally of one of the <hi>Ptolomies,</hi> which had ſourty ranks of Oars, and could carry Three thouſand Souldiers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides Four hundred Saylers, and Four thouſand ſlaves; but ſo vaſt and unweildy, that 'twas impoſſible to ſet it to Sea, and it ſerv'd only to look upon. Let us not accuſe Arts and Sciences for this, 'tis not their fault; 'tis the imperfection of humane Wit, not ſtrong e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to bear them, or able enough to manage them; but as a ſick or weak Souldier, is oppreſs'd or hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd with his own Arms. Our excellent Friend was none of theſe, and if there be need of an illuſtrious Witneſs, we will produce no other but that Prince, great by Birth, great for his Mind and Courage; a Prince
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:62940:14"/>who judg'd not by others Eyes or Opinions, but by his own, and who a thouſand times, when inviron'd with a croud of perſons of quality and merit, found an entire Court in M. <hi>Saraſin;</hi> whether he was to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate, or execute; to negotiate important and publick Affairs; to rely upon him for the conduct of his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate; or ſought a Converſation ſolid and learned, or would relieve himſelf by a pleaſant one.</p>
            <p>Could I but repreſent by ſome great and bold ſtroke of my Pencil the charms of his Converſation, as they are impreſs'd in my memory; but it happens here as in all other excellent things, it is eaſie to ſay what they are not, and hard to deſcribe what they are. If it be asked me, What had Monſieur <hi>Saraſin</hi> in him ſo uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally to pleaſe? He had nothing of that which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſes in moſt Learned men, and in ſuch as make profeſſion of Letters. Some, either by a vertue too auſtere, or by a Scorn which renders them ſcorn'd, hold no commerce but with the Learned, and volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily renounce the Society of the greateſt part of the World: they do wrong to Philoſophy, for men inſtead of conceiving under this name, good ſenſe and love of reaſon, which naturally hath a thouſand charms, fancy ſomething ſtrange and barbarous, which renders men of bad humors, and will not let them be Sociable; they forget that <hi>Socrates</hi> their Founder and Father (if they are his legitimate Off-ſpring) would laugh, and dance as other men, and thought nothing unworthy of him, but Vice. There are others who have not this peeviſhneſs nor fierceneſs, but by a too ſtrong application to their deſigns, are alwaies divided, and carry but half them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to any place, ſtill looking aſide, as a Lover far from his Miſtreſs. Others, that have but little expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of the World, though a great Judgment, ſtir not but with fear, as in a ſtrange Countrey; they ſay nothing through a too curious choice what they
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:62940:15"/>ſhould ſay, and we may divine their minds ſooner than ſee them. On the contrary, others abuſe the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation they have got; they ſpeak well, but they ſpeak alwaies; they ſpeak continually excellent things, but they will not let others do it; whereas they ſhould do in Converſation, what that Ancient did in the Commonwealth, when he retir'd ſometimes to let Vertues leſs bright than his own appear. What ſhall I ſay of thoſe that can talk of nothing, but of their Works? of thoſe that pleaſe at hand, but having ſtill the ſame thing to ſay, grow as tedious the ſecond time, as they were delightful the firſt? of thoſe, who to ſhew their Wit are continually contradicting? thoſe Opinionative men, who, whether it be through a fooliſh Pride, diſpute againſt the Truth they know, which is a vice unworthy of an honeſt man; or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be that they can never know it, being once pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſt, which is alwaies a great fault; or whether they ſuſtain trifling matters unſeaſonably, or with too much heat, without complacency, without diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is a great weakneſs. But this is a matter without bounds wherein I am engaged. I ſtop here, and it ſhall be enough to ſay, None of theſe weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes were diſcoverable in our Friend, and whether by this or by a thouſand rare qualities, he pleas'd all different ſorts of Spirits, as if he never thought of pleaſing but one of them. The Ladies, the Learned, the Courtiers; in Affairs, in Pleaſures; whether he held a place in a regulated and ſerious Converſation, or whether amongſt his Friends and Acquaintance he was carried to thoſe innocent debauches of mind, thoſe ſage Follies, wherein ſerious Diſcourſes give way to the capriccio's and ends of Poetry, where every thing is in ſeaſon, except cold and ſevere reaſon. But it is time to put an end to this long Diſcourſe, wherein I fear to have taken pains for my own ſhame rather
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:62940:15"/>than for Monſieur <hi>Saraſin</hi>'s honour; however, I have done what I chiefly deſir'd to do, for I have given publick marks of the Eſteem I had for him; may they be as immortal as his Works. I may be accus'd for having ſaid too much, but when I conſult the paſſion I have for his glory, I reproach my ſelf for not having ſaid enough; and I know well, that if I had not rejected ſeveral things that came into my mind upon this rich and abundant Subject, I had ſaid much more.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Eing come to <hi>Paris</hi> to juſtifie my Innocence and oppoſe the Calumnies of mine Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, whilſt I expected anſwer of Letters written to the Court in my favour, and was in the mean time retir'd with my intimate Friend M. <hi>P.</hi> one day after dinner M. <hi>Chappelein, Trilport</hi> and <hi>Menage</hi> came to viſit me. Theſe Gentlemen concern'd themſelves infinitely in my diſgrace, and acted in my behalf with a noble heart, not to be found in the Hiſtories of <hi>Oreſtes</hi> and <hi>Pilades,</hi> and other Friends of antiquity. They ſound me in the Hall, where I was hearkning to an excellent Muſician:
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:62940:17"/>I believed, ſaid Monſ. <hi>Chappelein</hi> addreſſing himſelf to me, that in this your Retirement I ſhould rather have found you faſten'd to <hi>Seneca</hi>'s Treatiſe, which proves, that a wiſe man is not ſubject to the Injuries of Fortune, than pleaſing your ſelf with Muſick, which ordinarily does not delight any, but unperplexed minds. This ought not to ſurprize you, anſwer'd I; for firſt you do me wrong to eſteem me of a perplexed mind, ſeeing you know that my Conſcience is very clear: and though this ſeem ſtrange to you, you that have been accuſtom'd to regulate your vertue by that of the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> and would have us, as they, encounter Misfortunes with a ſtubborn brow, and not take off our thoughts from the Evil we are to combat, till we have made a perfect conqueſt of it; yet it is convenient for us who follow another Sect, and by another biaſs defend our ſelves from Grief, not to wreſtle with it, and to endeavour rather to forget, than to vanquiſh it. This is, ſaid M. <hi>Menage,</hi> the Opinion of <hi>Epicurus,</hi> who will have us dream of Pleaſures to take us off from the thought of Pains, and ordains, that we maſter it by Diverſion. Truly we muſt acknowledge, purſu'd he, that this mans Philoſophy does marvellouſly aſſiſt Nature, and that his Opinions are very well accommodated to our weakneſs; and I cannot enough praiſe our excellent <hi>Gaſſend,</hi> whom we may call, as they did <hi>Epicurus,</hi> the Father of Truth, or ar they called <hi>Socrates,</hi> the Father of Philoſophy; we cannot, I ſay, praiſe him enough for having employ'd that profound crudition, and long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, which hath got him ſo many Admirers to clear up what remains of the Doctrine of this Philoſopher, and anew to found a School, whoſe Diſciples once fill'd whole Towns in <hi>Greece.</hi> I am very glad, reply'd I, that you have not inſulted over this Author of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, with the moſt part of the World, who are deceived by this laſt word, and who do not dream that the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:62940:17"/>true <hi>Epicureans</hi> lead a life as regular as our reform'd Monks; and that you may the better ſee I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat Grief by flying it, ſee but the Books I read in my idle hours, you will not find <hi>Boetius</hi> or <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pictetus</hi> among them. Hereupon M. <hi>Trilport</hi> coming to the Table found a <hi>Lucretius,</hi> a <hi>Saluſt</hi> and the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of <hi>Perceforets,</hi> and turning towards me; The firſt of theſe Books, ſaith he, is proper for you, the other is one of our old Tales; but as for <hi>Saluſt,</hi> who can make an Hiſtorian one of the Diſciples of <hi>Epicurus,</hi> who forbids his to meddle with the Commonwealth? I am not ſworn, reply'd I, to obſerve all the Rules of this Philoſopher, and I only follow thoſe Opinions of his, to which my Reaſon and Nature carry me. But, ſaith he, again opening <hi>Lucretius,</hi> I find you very bold to read Verſe, you that know 'tis Verſe hath done you ſo many bad offices. 'Tis true, anſwer'd I, that I owe a great deal of ill-will to the Muſes, but 'tis to my own: for I might have read all the Verſes in the World, if I had not made Verſes. It was time for me to retire, for having wrot
<q>
                  <l>Qu'Eve ayma mieux pour s'en faire conter,</l>
                  <l>Preſter l'oreille aux fleurettes du Diable,</l>
                  <l>Que d'eſtre femme, &amp; ne pas coquetter.</l>
               </q>I was ſo embroil'd with the Sex, that I know no E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legies ſo lamentable, nor Stanza's ſo flattering, that could charm the wrath of our Ladies. Perhaps then, replied M. <hi>Chappelein,</hi> you have not only bid adieu to <hi>Phoebus</hi> and the nine Siſters, but alſo to <hi>Cupid</hi> and his Mother; and do not you remember, adds M. <hi>Trilport,</hi> the Verſe of our Country man <hi>Bertaut?</hi>
            </p>
            <q>Que s'empeſcher d'aymer eſt dur aux belles ames.</q>
            <p>I remember nothing but what follows, anſwer'd I;</p>

            <pb n="32" facs="tcp:62940:18"/>
            <p>And to ſpeak freely, retiring from the Service of Ladies, I rather think I have cur'd my ſelf of a ſmall Diſeaſe, than deprived my ſelf of a great pleaſure. For this time, ſays M. <hi>Menage,</hi> you ſhall not be alone; and you ſee one that hath long ſince hung up his Chains in the Temple of Liberty. Away, away, ſays, M. <hi>Chappelein,</hi> you are ingrateful Fellows; for not to mind you of your good Fortunes, do you not remember, that what you have of Civility and Politeneſs, you have learnt it of Ladies, who have ſuffer'd you and been belov'd by you? Truly, replied I, I could anſwer you, that I never was happy enough to obtain that which you call Good fortune, and proteſt to you with the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> that
<q>Amador fui mas, nunca fui amado.</q>However, that you may not conteſt on this point, I am content to tell you, that for the Civility and Polite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which you pretend we owe to Ladies, methinks there needs nothing but my Example to ſatisfie you, that a man may ſpend much time with them, yet not acquire theſe Two qualities; but becauſe I impute it to my inability, that I come forth rude and unpoliſh'd from their Converſation, I leave it to M. <hi>Menage,</hi> againſt whom you have addreſt your Reproaches as well as againſt me, and in whom you may juſtly admire all thoſe good qualities which I want, to explain if it hath been the company of Ladies that hath render'd him ſo accompliſh'd. Truce, if you pleaſe, with your Complements, ſays M. <hi>Menage,</hi> let it ſuffice you that I do not aſpire ſo high, and that I pretend not to paſs for <hi>Baldaſſars</hi> Courtier, who never liv'd but in <hi>Cice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi>'s Oratory, in <hi>Plato</hi>'s and Sr. <hi>Tho. More</hi>'s Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth: But whether it be that I am not of Mr. <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelein</hi>'s opinion, I, that am accus'd not to accuſtome my ſelf to be of other mens, or whether I pleaſe my
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:62940:18"/>ſelf to oppoſe them, as you often ſay I do; ſeeing there are no Women here, I cannot diſſemble, that whatever advantage we may expect from their Converſation, we meet on the contrary with ſo many things in it that may hinder us from becoming gallant men, that I am ready to diſpute againſt the old Theſis, which expoſes it as a thing impoſſible for a man to be very proper for the World, if he hath not been amorous in his youth. And I, ſays M. <hi>Cha.</hi> am ready to maintain it againſt you. For my part, ſays M. <hi>Trilport</hi> turning himſelf to M. <hi>Ch.</hi> I declare my ſelf your Second, if M. <hi>M.</hi> can find one in ſo unjuſt a cauſe, as he is about to defend. If the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter were not gone ſo far, added I, and that he had been content to ſuſtain, that Ladies were good Friends, but very dangerous Miſtreſſes, I think I had ſerv'd him againſt you; but ſeeing he carries things to extremity, I cannot be of his ſide. 'Tis not the firſt time, replies M. <hi>M.</hi> that you have come with odds againſt me, yet for all that, not only I have not fled for it, but I have not been vanquiſh'd. Wherefore I once more reſolve, having propoſed any thing to imitate <hi>Arioſto's Rodomont,</hi> who call'd forth the Knights to combat two and two, or three and three, and to take for my Motto
<q>Horatio Sol contra Tuſcana tutta.</q>What you ſay, anſwer'd M. <hi>Trilport,</hi> obliges us alſo, notwithſtanding your <hi>Rodomontado,</hi> to imitate thoſe Knights, who never went two againſt one; and ſeeing M. <hi>Ch.</hi> is he that took up the gage of defiance, which you had thrown down, we will let him enter firſt into the Liſts, and I doubt not to ſee him come out Victorious. If this happens to mee, replies M. <hi>Ch.</hi> 'twill be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs more by the force of truth, than by mine: for if his cauſe were juſt, I ſhould eſteem my ſelf loſt, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him a long-winded Knight of great force; or, to
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:62940:19"/>ſpeak more familiarly and quit the Romantick Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor, knowing no man more apt than he to maintain Paradoxes, no not amongſt us <hi>Stoicks,</hi> who make a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſtudy of it. But, ſays M. <hi>M.</hi> I do not hold what I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend ſo Paradoxical as you imagine; and to let you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand ſo much, ſeeing we have time enough, conſider the Reaſons on which I ground my Opinion. After theſe words being ſilent a while, and ſeeing we prepared to hearken to what he had to ſay, he began again thus; I have lov'd, and often
<q>
                  <l>Sans faire levain, mon avanture a eſté telle</l>
                  <l>Que de la meſme ardeur, que j'ay bruſlé pour elle,</l>
                  <l>elle a bruſlé pour moy.</l>
               </q>I am forc'd in ſpite of my modeſty to ſpeak to you at this rate, to the end that being to declare much ill of Love, this may take from you all imagination, that I go about to revenge my ſelf for bad uſage: and alſo, that you may give me an entire belief, ſeeing that I know the good and the ill by my own experience; for, in my opinion, <hi>Hannibal</hi> had reaſon to mock the <hi>Greek</hi> Oratour that gave him Military Leſſons, and the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour had had no leſs occaſion to laugh, if <hi>Hanibal</hi> had undertaken afterwards to ſhew him the precepts of Rhetorick. We cannot diſcourſe well of things which we have not practis'd, and often the uſe does not agree with the ſpeculation; but I who have
<q>Couru les mers d'amour di rivage en rivage,</q>and know all that is done in the Cloyſter of this God, to ſpeak with <hi>Petrarch;</hi> I may well methinks be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in what I ſhall ſay. So much the more alſo as I find my ſelf at preſent in a condition to ſpeak of it with an intire indifferency; but becauſe to judge of the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:62940:19"/>effects of a thing 'tis neceſſary we know the nature, we ſhall not do amiſs to inform our ſelves who this Love is, that you would have the Author of ſo much good to Mankind, and of whom you ſuſtain, that young peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have as much need as of Academies and Colledges. I will alſo do you this favour, not to enquire News of him any where, but in your Books, and as I ſpeak to the chief Poet of our Age and Nation, I will ſerve my ſelf of the Opinions of thoſe Great men of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity to whom you have ſucceeded. They ſay then, that Love is a Child; they put a Ribband over his eyes; they clap wings to his ſhoulders; they hang a quiver of Arrows by his ſide; they arm his two hands with a Bow and a Torch: Thus far this Figure does not make for you, and to conſider the outſide of this Picture, <hi>Cupid</hi> appears only a piece of <hi>Groteſque,</hi> or a <hi>Chimera.</hi> But you will tell me that Poetry hath its myſteries, and we muſt not do that wrong to the men you eſteem, and who had the honour to be the firſt Philoſophers of the World, to think, that without reaſon they deſign'd Love under ſo ſtrange a Figure. I know that the extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary things which Poetry preſents have all of them a hidden ſenſe, and that ſhe ſerves her ſelf of ſtrange and ſurprizing Pictures to draw the vulgar to the ſearch of truth. The Modern <hi>Italians,</hi> who have out-done the Invention of the <hi>Greeks</hi> (for the <hi>Latins</hi> did but copy them) expoſe nothing ſo fantaſtical, to which they have not fixt an Allegory, and tell us, that their Enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, their Furies, their Gyants, their Monſters, and other pieces of Knight-errantry are only to allure the People, and to inſtruct them whilſt they ſeem alſo to pleaſe them: But I go further and ſay, that amongſt all the Images, which Poetry hath repreſented to us, there is none more ingenious than this of Love; ſo naturally it expreſſes this paſſion. Wherefore let us examine it, if you pleaſe, and we will conſider firſt this Child <hi>Love.</hi>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:62940:20"/>Here I demand of you, if you were to repreſent For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, Prudence, or any of the Vertues, ſhould it be under this Figure? I am confident you will anſwer me, that you ſhould like better to draw an armed <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las,</hi> or ſhew a <hi>Hercules</hi> overcoming a Lion; but on the contrary, if you were to deſcribe Weakneſs, Impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, Softneſs, Incontinency, and many other of our bad qualities, what could ſerve better to this deſign than the Picture of a <hi>Child?</hi> What think you Poetry would teach us by this? nothing doubtleſs, but that a man is ſubjected to all the imperfections of Childhood, when he becomes amorous. So the <hi>Comicks</hi> introduce Love upon their Theaters, without counſel, without guide; accompanied with Suſpitions, Injuries, Enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; ſometimes in Truce, ſometimes in Peace, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in War; and find that theſe diſorders and inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities are ſo natural to him, that they conclude, 'twould be the utmoſt of Follies to believe we can love wiſely. And 'tis no wonder a Poet in love found out, that he who firſt painted Love a <hi>Child</hi> had an admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble hand, becauſe he firſt diſcover'd how Lovers paſs their life, that they are depriv'd of good ſenſe, that they loſe ſolid goods to run after toys; but the worſt is, that theſe Toys and theſe light Cares do often conſume our whole life, and remain with us to decrepitude. I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine then, what a ſight it is to find an Old man making Love, and who, like an Ape to run after Nuts, tears the Robe of Philoſophy wherewith he was clad; to ſee an Old woman every morning put on a forein Face, dreſs her ſelf up like a Puppet, and buy the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jolleries of a Younger brother with the beſt of her For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes. 'Tis for this ſome body ſays <hi>Venus</hi> is angry with Old people, that Marriage does not become them, and as a Poet in <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſings
<q>
                  <l>Qu'autant vieillard à la barbe fleurie,</l>
                  <l>Pour ſes voiſins que pour ſey ſe marie.</l>
               </q>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:62940:20"/>And you may remember, that in Old times they pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly hooted at theſe Gallants of <hi>Proſerpine,</hi> and that againſt their approach they armed themſelves with the ſame preſervatives that Pagan Superſtition had ordain'd for the worſt things. In fine, to continue Love when we begin to ceaſe to live is a dotage moſt deplorable, and there is nothing more ſhameful than
<q>
                  <l>Les ridicules aventures</l>
                  <l>D'un amoreux en cheueux gris.</l>
               </q>I know not how to let you proceed, ſaid I, interrupting him, without praying you to ſpare M. <hi>G.</hi> and that you may not refuſe me, do but call to mind the pleaſure you once took to ſee him cheriſh his yellow Ribband which his Miſtreſs gave him, and how wittily he diſcours'd of this Favour of hers, ſo that you wanted little of wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Old age like his; at leaſt, reflecting upon his Nymph, his Muſick and his good Cheer you told us, he paſt this age as <hi>Horace</hi> had wiſh'd. Truly, added M. <hi>Trilport,</hi> the Romance of his life is ſo pleaſant a thing, that I think 'twould be ſpoil'd ſhould it be reduc'd to a ſerious Hiſtory, and as I have the reputation of ſolicit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the affairs of my Friends, I alſo recommend him to your favour. M. <hi>Menage</hi> calling to mind the Verſe of <hi>Taſſo,</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>Habbia vita (riſpoſe) é libertade:</l>
                  <l>E nulla a tanto interceſſor ſi negbi.</l>
               </q>for there is no fear that this one Swallow ſhould lead back the Spring to Old men, which is the ſeaſon of Courtſhip, nor that a general defect can be excuſed by by one mans merit. But to return to our Diſcourſe, this <hi>Child</hi> is Naked; in this without doubt appears his Imprudence, at leaſt if we will believe the old Maxime, That there is nothing more ſhameful, than to ſtrip our
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:62940:21"/>ſelves before all the Worid, and if he will believe <hi>Euſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> who calls Love the Father of Impudence: unleſs we may ſay, that he is painted Naked to let us underſtand, that he ruins his Followers even to the deſpoiling them of every thing. Let us now paſs on to the equipage they give him: They ſay then he has a Ribband before his eyes; what do you think this Blindneſs ſignifies; but that the Soul of a Lover is in an eternal darkneſs, and that Reaſon knows not which way to turn her ſelf, having Paſſion for her Guide? There is an <hi>Italian</hi> who will not let reaſon ſcape ſo, but ſays ſhe is dead, whereas we only ſay, ſhe goes aſtray. Now without divining, and to ſpeak only according to our Love-Writers, do you know what excuſe they betake themſelves to, when they would defend the Irregularities of their thoughts, or action? they think that whatever extravagancy they commit they apologize enough, when they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt that, thanks to Love, they cannot ſee what they do; and that you may not appeal from theſe hearken to <hi>Ovid,</hi> who hath made an art of a Paſſion, and given rules for a Folly; he does not only grant, that Lovers do not ſee what is reaſon, but he carries their Blindneſs even to a want of good manners, and exempts none from this defect. In the mean time, that this Ribband may not be taken off, that is, that Reaſon may not return to Lovers, ſuch as are not willing this madneſs ſhould have its lucid intervals, are not content to cover Loves eyes, but they wholly take away the uſe of his ſight. In this condition, methinks they ſhould rather furniſh him with a Dog and a Staff to conduct him, than faſten Wings to his ſhoulders; and as often as I fancy him blind and flying, I am fearful he ſhould maim himſelf againſt ſome Tree, ſome Tower, or ſome Mountain. I doubt not but thoſe who have thus made a Bird of him, would have left him a plain humane Figure, rather than thus have ſhap'd a Monſter, if they could have imagined any
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:62940:21"/>other way to ſend him about the World, which they pretend is neceſſary for its conſervation: but conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he could not do ſo many things at once, nor, for Example, in one day wound a <hi>Negro</hi> and ſcorch a <hi>Greenlander</hi> benum'd with cold, thoſe which drink of the <hi>Seine</hi> and thoſe which enrich themſelves with the Sands of <hi>Plata,</hi> if they had not furniſh'd him with an invention to make theſe long Journies; they found no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo proper as to apply Wings to him, but Wings not only more fit for a flight than thoſe of Falcons, but more light than the Winds, or than thought it ſelf. I remember one day in diſcourſe with M. <hi>C.</hi> M. <hi>R.</hi> and <hi>A.</hi> the firſt very pleaſantly maintain'd, that conſidering all theſe great labours, Love was no better handled by Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets than their <hi>Siſiphus,</hi> ſeeing they employed him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually in a work that ſeem'd more intolerable, than the rolling of his Stone; the ſecond added freely, that it ſeem'd to him he was the more tormented, ſeeing they had to double his drudgery, choſen the Night for him, which Nature appoints for the Reſt of all Creatures; but the conceit of the third, that excellent Tranſlator, who gives to his Copies the livelineſs of their Originals, was yet more malicious, for concerning Loves Feathers he explained <hi>Petrarchs</hi> Verſes,
<q>
                  <l>In coſi tenebroſ a eſtretta gabbia</l>
                  <l>Rinchiuſi fummo, oue le penne uſato</l>
                  <l>Mutui per tempo.</l>
               </q>He pretended this ſtrait and dark Cage, and this mew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Feathers reſpected rather the Health than the Manners. But to return to the Allegorical ſenſe of theſe Wings; they ſignifie nothing but the Inconſtancy, the inſtability of our Loves; nothing but an uncertain and ſhameful agitation in the actions of Lovers. <hi>Propertius</hi> calls theſe wings Winds, and marvellouſly ſtrengthens
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:62940:22"/>our explication, for they are to turn Lovers about as ſo many uncertain Weathercocks. It remains only that we examine <hi>Cupid</hi>'s Arms, his Arrows, whereof ſome are of Lead, ſome of Gold; and his Torch, which pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrates even to the marrow, and which burnt <hi>Troy</hi> the Great. Certainly 'tis in the uſe of theſe Arms that he ſhews himſelf ſtark blind, for he ſtrikes any where and on all ſides. Sometimes he makes a Monarch adore the daughter of a Dunghil: but let that paſs; Merit is to be found every where. But what will you ſay to ſee Old men make love to young Wenches, and Old wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men fond of ill-featur'd Boys; Wiſe men ſigh for a fooliſh Goſſip; to ſee this irregularity paſs even to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſpecies? Do not you wonder to find in the liſt of your Lovers a Dragon, an Elephant, a Peacock; and, to ſerve you in Fiſh and Fleſh, a number of Dolphins? You know the ſtory, how this Dragon lay every night with a young Maid of <hi>Etolia,</hi> and beat her when he thought he had occaſion to be Jealous; you know how an Elephant in love with an Herb-wiſe brought her Noſegays, whilſt the Grammarian <hi>Ariſtophanes</hi> ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour'd of the ſame Wench, was jealouſly enrag'd at the Careſſes of his mighty Rival, whom he durſt not provoke: to repeat here the Hiſtory of <hi>Dolphins</hi> were to loſe time. If we will turn the Medal, we ſhall find on the other ſide our Nature intreagu'd with ſtrange Paſſions; and <hi>Plutarch</hi> will tell us, that the <hi>Minotaurs, Sphinxes</hi> and <hi>Centaurs,</hi> were the products of theſe little Loves, and we ſhall praiſe <hi>Thales</hi> for adviſing <hi>Perian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> to marry his Sheapherds betimes; but we can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver call to mind the Adventure of the Golden Aſs and that honeſt Lady, without Laughing a little; and when we conſider 'twas Love did it, how can we forbear to cry out with the <hi>Italians, bella botta?</hi> You ſee then, by this unreaſonable employment of his Arrows to how many poor affections our minds are betrayed when
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:62940:22"/>Love governs them; to what tranſports we abandon our ſelves againſt the Laws of Honour and Society; to how many fooliſh paſſions we expoſe our lives. I think, for my part, 'twere better to be wounded with a poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned Arrow, than with theſe dangerous Shafts where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we ſpeak; and that the Torches of the Furies would not torment us with ſo much rage, as that does which Love wields: at leaſt the effects are not more dangerous; and thoſe Lovers which this flame devours, dream no leſs of Poyſon and Poignards, nor are leſs tormented with Fears and Jealouſies, and the reſt of ſuch diſorders, than Criminals with their eternal pains, and the remorſe of their Conſciences. I had forgot this Gold and this Lead which tips his Arrows, whereof the firſt give us love, the other cauſe averſion. To ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain this difference, you muſt remember that Poverty, which <hi>Petronius</hi> calls the Siſter of Wit, having often hindred Poets from being happy in their loves, for Old men and Fools with their Gold are wont to drive them from Families, to which they promiſed no leſs than Immortality, they have invented theſe Golden ſhafts which find nothing impenetrable; and thoſe Leaden ones, which 'tis true belong to the ſame Quiver, but are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies blunt, though Love lets them flie with never ſo much force. The Maſter of Lovers writes, that he does not compoſe his Precepts for the Rich. And <hi>Homer</hi> the Dean and Founder of poeſie tells them, if they have nothing but Verſe, they ſhall be chaſed from <hi>Lais</hi> Street as well as from <hi>Plato</hi>'s Commonwealth: by all which we may eaſily judge, that theſe Golden Arrows ſignifie 'tis Money drives the trade of Love, and that Covetouſneſs over-rules Merit and Beauty. There is no Law which does not ſtoop to his Shafts, according to the ſaying of Count <hi>Villa Mediana,</hi> who might well know them: After many diſorders, which they had cauſed in his Fortune and in his Life, he became their
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:62940:23"/>Victim; for you know very well what <hi>Jupiter</hi> thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd on this <hi>Ixion,</hi> ſeeing 'tis a Story of our times: and it ſeem'd he was better contented with Deaths Arrow, than with all thoſe we ſpeak of; at leaſt he that was in the Coach with him when he was kill'd reports, that when he received the wound whereof he imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately died, he ſaid no more, but <hi>C'en eſt fait,</hi> as if he had freed himſelf of a troubleſome buſineſs. This Count then, who was the Honour of Courtſhip, and the Wit of the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> who had a fair Eſtate, was of a great hope and a great Merit, and whoſe Purſe was never tied, but with an Onion-peel, as an Ancient would have thoſe of Lovers to be, amongſt his Works hath left us theſe Verſes,
<q>
                  <l>De tus flechas por ſer d'oro</l>
                  <l>Ninguna leiſe deffiende.</l>
               </q>He would ſay, after thoſe experiences which his Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality had given him, that Preſents are ſtrange Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. Let us confeſs the Infamy of this traffick, ſeeing nothing can be ſo ſordid as to ſell Friendſhip, nothing more baſe than to love for Money. And truly, having conſidered ſo many defects, we may well ſubſcribe to what one writes of Love, That by a juſt Sentence of the great Gods he was baniſhed from their aſſembly, becauſe he diſturb'd it and fill'd Heaven with Seditions: and further, That theſe Gods when they caſt him down to Earth cut off his Wings to beſtow them upon Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, and to hinder him from ever mounting to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven again; and they might well have added, That when Love left <hi>Olympus</hi> for Earth, Peace abandoned men to fly up to Heaven. In the mean time, there's your <hi>Cupid</hi> in a pitiful predicament, and all his myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries diſcovered little to his advantage. This is his true portraict, wherein I have laboured according to Nature, and I dare ſay with much ſucceſs: for, though my Way is not good, yet the piece is perfectly like him,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:62940:23"/>and in one word I can excuſe my bad Rhetorick by the ordinary <hi>Quodlibet</hi> and ſay, that my Picture wants no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but words. O Painter <hi>Apelles,</hi> Painter <hi>Zeuxes,</hi> cries out M. <hi>Chapp.</hi> why are not you now alive? you had learnt much by copying this piece, which exceeds all yours; and profited ſtrangely under this new Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, whoſe works paſs Nature, whereas yours only went even with Nature. I know not how you underſtand it, ſaid I, but methinks you do not praiſe our Friends Picture by ſaying it ſurpaſſes Nature, whereas this Art is conſummate when it arrives to equal her. Truly, replies he, I did not deſign to make a Panegyrick, looking upon it as a piece meant to pleaſe, whereof the invention ſeems handſom, and the order and colours may flatter our Judgment and Eyes; but I do not hold it for the true picture of Love, as I pretend to let you underſtand. In the mean time, ſaith M. <hi>Menage,</hi> I have advanced nothing, which I have not taken from ſome of your Fraternity; but becauſe you may reply, that Paſſion made them write againſt their Conſciences, and that I have only quoted them where they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain; to act ſincerely with you, I muſt tell you, that I have diſplay'd none of Loves defects, whereof I am not ready to give you Examples; and now I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented this folly, I will let you ſee ſome illuſtrious Fools. So having taken breath he began again thus: I will not entertain you with the ſtory of <hi>Iphis,</hi> whoſe Love forc'd her to hang her ſelf for the cruel <hi>Anaxar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches;</hi> nor with the diſorders of a great many others. The Examples of theſe particulars profit little, becauſe no man eſteems enough the Loves of the Vulgar to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate his own by them; and all blame the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of the Common People inſtead of correcting their own by them. Let us caſt our eyes then up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the great <hi>Atrides,</hi> whom the whole <hi>Greek</hi> Nation, the wiſeſt and moſt ingenious of the World, choſe for
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:62940:24"/>their Chief: He perhaps was elected by the <hi>Greeks,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were of your opinion; they knew him of an Amarous complexion, and judg'd that this tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rament would enable him for great matters. Let us look a little nearer, and ſee if it were ſo: The firſt and moſt notable Action of his Generalſhip was to preſent his Daughter <hi>Iphigenia</hi> to be Sacrificed when the gods ſtopp'd his Fleet at the Port of <hi>Aulide,</hi> and would be appeaſed by this victim. This action ſeems at firſt bluſh above the common Vertue; but if I ſhould tell you that he corrupted the Mariners to give out, that the Winds were contrary, and <hi>Neptune</hi> wroth; that he ſpent ſome daies in the preparation of this execrable Sacrifice, to give time to his Emiſſaries to find out a certain Boy of whom he was deſperately enamour'd; you would cry out, Is this the man whoſe Magnanimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ennobled him above all others, and upon whom all <hi>Greece</hi> had turn'd its eye? I paſs with ſilence ſo many wretches which he ſuffered to die of the Plague in the Camp of <hi>Troy,</hi> becauſe he would not deliver the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Prieſteſs <hi>Chryſis.</hi> I inſiſt not on the quarrel he had with <hi>Achilles,</hi> when he carried away <hi>Briſeide,</hi> by which Rape he not only retarded the taking of <hi>Ili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> but endangered the <hi>Greek</hi> Veſſels to be fn'd. I only let you know, that when he carried away <hi>Caſſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſandra</hi> from her houſe <hi>al diſpetto di Madonna Clitem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtra,</hi> he provoked the vengeance of his Wife, and arm'd for his execution the weak and effeminate hand of <hi>Egiſtus.</hi> But his Rival, the man that was nouriſh'd with the marrow of Lions; brought up under the diſcipline of <hi>Chiron;</hi> ſo robuſt that no man could uſe his Launce; <hi>Achilles,</hi> for whom the death of <hi>Hector</hi> was reſerv'd; what does he when <hi>Agamemnon</hi> ſtole his Miſtreſs? doubtleſs ſomething high and noble, for he was a Hero and a Lover; firſt he rayl'd at the King with the ſcoldings of an Oiſter-wife, calling him
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:62940:24"/>Cuckold and dirty Dog, whereby he diſparag'd the <hi>Gentaur</hi> which ſhould have brought him up better. When that would not do, the pitiful fellow went crying to his Mother, and ſtay'd in his Ship far from the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and at the expence of his Reputation. But what will you ſay to <hi>Hercules,</hi> that mighty tame of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, when you ſhall find him ſitting by <hi>Omphale,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving chang'd his Lions-skin for a Peticoat, and when you ſee him
<q>
                  <l>—de la clava noderoſa in vece</l>
                  <l>Trattar il fuſo, e la conocchia imbelle?</l>
               </q>Can you like the condition to which Love had reduc'd this gentle Spinſter? rather would you not wiſh, as the Captain in <hi>Terence,</hi> that the Wenches had clap'd his Cheeks with their Pattins. But not to ſpend time in reckoning up the Follies of the amorous Hero's of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, let us go directly to the Fountain, and conſider the Father of gods and men, <hi>Jupiter</hi> that darts the Thunderbolt, who makes <hi>Olympus</hi> tremble with one wink of his eye, who brags, that with a Chain tied to his Toe he will toſs the reſt of the gods out of Earth into Heaven: We ſhall find him, ſaving the reſpect I owe to to Poetical Divinities, as very a fool as the reſt. Nay, he is worſe handled by Love; and <hi>Petrarch,</hi> who had ſeen the Triumph, ſings, that amongſt all the gods which paſt before the Chariot of Love, he was moſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt with the number and weight of his Chains. 'Twould be tedious to repeat here all his Metamorpho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, or to conſider this Governour of the World ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times like a Gooſe, ſometimes in ſome other Figure as ridiculous; 'tis better let <hi>Ovid</hi> conclude upon this Subject, and to believe him when he ſays, that <hi>Jupiter</hi> by his Loves diſhonoured himſelf and all his Houſe. O <hi>Love,</hi> how excellent are thy inſpirations! and how neceſſary are thou to humane Vertue! I ſee by M. <hi>Ch.</hi>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:62940:25"/>looks, that he is vext to hear me thus ſcoff at the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Homer,</hi> and that he is in a great deal of impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience to anſwer me; I will give way to you preſently. In the mean time, if you are not contented with Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples out of the Fable and the old Hiſtory; if you will tell me, that the Inhabitants of <hi>Parnaſſus</hi> ſing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is not ſubject to Caution; that honeſt <hi>Homer</hi> ſlept ſometimes, and that a good Poet is but a bad Witneſs; I will leave your Hero's and your Gods at reſt, and will ſhut my eyes, that I may not obſerve in them the Imperfections of Lovers. I know you have your anſwers ready, and that ſome Mythologiſt is at hand to relieve you; but I am ſure they have nothing to ſay to <hi>Plato,</hi> nor to <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and theſe are Men of ſuch weight, that if you will lay them by, I know not upon whom we may caſt our eyes to examine humane Actions. But I imagine, you have a ſecret content to ſce theſe two marvellous Wits number'd with the Lovers, and indeed, if amidſt their Loves they had preſerv'd thoſe great lights with which they penetrated the moſt obſcure Science, and ſo prudently eſtabliſh'd Rules of Manners, Conduct of Families, Polity of Cities, and Government of States, you had reaſon to be proud. But on the contrary, if Love hath no leſs darken'd theſe all-ſeeing eyes than thoſe of the Vulgar, and that this Paſſion hath made theſe great minds deſcend to Fooleries, dare you ſtill maintain, that Love is neceſſary to Mankind? See how the thing goes: <hi>Plato</hi> being yet young became amorous of <hi>Aſter,</hi> and immediately ſuffer'd in his underſtanding. He never lay down, but he call'd<note n="*" place="margin">Aſter was a Boy.</note> her <hi>Lucifer</hi> and <hi>Heſper;</hi> and according to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary gibberiſh of Lovers, plac'd her above the Stars. If he were to bid her farewel, he preſently complain'd he had loſt his North-Star, and that his Reaſon was benighted. But the Epigram he
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:62940:25"/>compoſed for <hi>Archianaſſa</hi> ſhews us more plainly, that Wiſdom goes out of the Head when Love gets in. This Woman approach'd Old age, ſo that he could not ſay ſhe was the <hi>Aurora</hi> or the <hi>Sun,</hi> but he muſt write high Lines and make <hi>Phoebus</hi> ſpeak in her praiſe; but ſee an Impudence that never any Poet durſt be guilty of, whatever Hyperboles they have invented in favour of their Ladies: <hi>Plato</hi> ſeeing that in this ſurrow'd-face there was no room for Beauty, thought fit to ſay, that Love hid himſelf in thoſe wrinckles as in an Ambuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cade; whereas, if he had had his Reaſon about him, he would have ſaid, that he lay there interr'd as in a ruinous Sepulchre. I know not, ſays M. <hi>Trilport,</hi> how you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it, but if you pretend to cenſure <hi>Plato</hi> for his Epigram, you pronounce your own Sentence. How ſo? demands M. <hi>Menage.</hi> See, replies M. <hi>Trilport,</hi> how your memory, that furniſhes you upon the place with ſo many handſom things, is wanting to you at your need, and in your own caſe: Do not you remember that you have made a Sonnet of this Epigram? and that you as well as <hi>Plato</hi> have had wrinckled Miſtreſſes. Truly, anſwer'd M. <hi>M.</hi> I had forgot that Sonnet and thoſe Miſtreſſes, and I do not care for remembring the Follics of my youth. For your Miſtreſſes, replies M. <hi>Trilport,</hi> let them be drown'd in <hi>Lethe,</hi> it ſhall not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble us; but the Sonnet would ſerve to excuſe this Action of the Philoſopher. One Folly, ſays M. <hi>M.</hi> cannot be the apology of another; and if my Sonnet forbids me urging the Epigram of <hi>Plato,</hi> I cannot ſee how you will defend the Verſe he compos'd, when he was in love with the fair <hi>Agathon,</hi> which ſays, he never kiſſed this. Beauty but he ſhut his Lips, for fear his ſlippery Soul ſhould ſally out. Now, what think you of this Kiſs? is it according to good Manners? is it not too wanton for a Philoſopher? is this handſom diſcourſe for a man they call Divine, as if it were too little to ſtyle him
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:62940:26"/>Wiſe? Beſides, this <hi>Plato</hi> in the reſt of his life was as very a Vagabond, and as inconſtant as <hi>Hylas</hi> in our <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrea,</hi> and like him went <hi>di ramo in ramo, di fior in fior:</hi> beſides the gallantries recited, he lov'd <hi>Phaedra,</hi> he lov'd <hi>Zantippe;</hi> perhaps it was <hi>Socrates</hi> Wife, and that he made a Cuckold of him the Oracle had pronounc'd the Wiſeſt man in the World. Cuckolds are very happy ſaid I, that have <hi>Socrates</hi> for their Patron. Let us not Jeſt, ſays M. <hi>M.</hi> upon ſo ſhameful an Action. This Gent. replies M. <hi>Ch.</hi> does here what <hi>Socrates</hi> would have done, who believ'd men ought not to lay matters of this nature ſo to heart, and would have been Scandal'd at it leſs than you are. I ſee how things go, continues M. <hi>M.</hi> you would ſupport vanquiſh'd Reaſon with a Jeſt, and I ſee you in ſo merry a humour upon this Subject, that I can expect nothing ſerious from you. Perhaps you will excuſe the Scholar as well as the Maſter, and find ſome pretence for the worſt of Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regularities into which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſell, when he Sacrificed to the Eunuch <hi>Hermia</hi>'s Concubine; but he Sacrificed not his Heart or his Liberty, which are the Imaginary offerings of our Lovers; he Sacrificed to her ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and to ſay all, in the ſame manner as the <hi>Athenians</hi> Sacrificed to <hi>Ceres.</hi> I ſhould be too tedious to ſtop up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Examples of other Philoſophers, and I have choſen only theſe two; firſt, becauſe publick Opinion hath placed them above the reſt: and further, becauſe it would have been only a repetition of the beſt part of <hi>Diogenes Laertius</hi> Hiſtory, which is full of the Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricks of thoſe which the World has worſhipped as the Lawgivers of Wiſdom. However, becauſe you may chance to ſuſpect the <hi>Grecian</hi> Faith, and deſpiſe beyond-Sea Manners, and becauſe our diſcourſe ſeems princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally to regard our Nation: We cannot abſtain from conſidering ſome one of our own, who have been ſlave to the Son of <hi>Venus;</hi> but they ſhall be Knights without
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:62940:26"/>reproach, whoſe Famous Acts raiſed them above others; Lovers of that age, when nothing in the World was ſo great as our Court, when <hi>Charlemain</hi> counted almoſt the daies of his Reign by the number of his Victories; when they preſerv'd Juſtice, protected Widows, defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Orphans, exterminated Tyrants, and with their Swords did more good to Mankind, than the Pens of <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> wrote. And now enter <hi>Orlando.</hi> Love made him an enraged Fool; but his folly was incurable, at leaſt as to the remedies of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen,</hi> and of ſo ſtrange a nature, that <hi>Aſtolpho</hi> mounts <hi>Elias</hi> Chariot and goes to fetch a little phial of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Senſe for him; and that out of St. <hi>John</hi>'s Shop, which the Poet makes a Chymick. I could produce <hi>Hannibal,</hi> who fail'd to Triumph over the <hi>Romans,</hi> and ruin'd the Reputation of his Countrey by giving himſelf up to the Careſſes of the <hi>Capuan</hi> Dames; and <hi>Antony,</hi> who loſt more by the love of <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> than by the genius of <hi>Auguſtus.</hi> I could mix Sacred ſtory with Prophane, and ſhew you <hi>David</hi> without Conſcience, <hi>Solonton</hi> without Wiſdom, <hi>Sampſon</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Strength; not to ſay any thing of our Father <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> whoſe Love coſt us ſo dear. But not to weary you with Examples, and yet to confirm my opinion, which I wiſh were yours, let us, if you pleaſe, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine with <hi>Petrarch</hi> a delicious Iſland cover'd with Roſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſhes, Jalſomine and Orange-trees; where the gentle <hi>Zephyrs</hi> temper and heat; where the Flowers perfume the Air; where Hills and Woods give ſhade; where the Winters are moderate, and where they paſs their time in Sports, Feaſts and Idleneſs; and now let us imagine, that Love has choſen this place to triumph in, and that here he has aſſembled all the Lovers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Poles: and in the laſt place let us imagine, that a Tempeſt hath caſt us upon this ſhoar; for I will never conſent that we go thither in quality of Lovers;
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:62940:27"/>'twere better we got thither upon a broken Plank, the remains of a Shipwrack, as to an Enemies Countrey, than to go before the wind in the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Queens Veſſel, if we went to pay our homage. Let us walk up and down a little, to refreſh our ſelves after the Voyage amongſt theſe troops of Lovers, upon theſe Flowers and in theſe Meadows; but on condition that we heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to their words, that we mark their actions, and that we judge then if it be good to imitate them. Theſe that firſt preſent themſelves ſeem very melancholy; at leaſt they have pale faces and heavy eyes, as if they had paſt the Night without ſleep. But O <hi>Jupiter,</hi> what diſcourſe! the firſt, who is clothed Paſtorally and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles the <hi>Myrtillus</hi> of <hi>Guarini,</hi> would have Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains weep for him, and the Winds ſigh out his Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom. See one there, that conſults the Echo, and is fooliſhly afflicted or joyed at what he ſays to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Another recounts his miſery to the Sun, to the Moon, to the Day, to the Night. He there ſays, he ſhould die contentedly, provided 'twere embracing her he loves, and that he might have it in an Epitaph. But mark him on the left hand quite deſpairing, for he curſes the day in which he began to love. His Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour ſeems more mad, and threatens no leſs than to break Loves Bow. But let us leave him for fear of miſchief, and let us approach the merry Troop. Some you may perceive dancing under the Green Trees: let's hear the burthen of their Song,
<q>
                  <l>La jou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iſſance eſt pleine</l>
                  <l>De peur d'un changement.</l>
               </q>See how imperfect their Joy is, they do not find their affairs well aſſured, though they are in the beſt condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they can wiſh. Now thoſe that ſtand by and look on are crown'd with Myrtle too, but for all that in an
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:62940:27"/>eternal inquietude. One torments himſelf to explain a word his Miſtreſs ſaid to him, becauſe he doubts 'tis not advantagious for him: Another complains, that his Lady look'd upon his Rival too long and too plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly. This laments, becauſe he believes he did ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize upon his Ladies Cheeks the remains of a Smile, wherewith ſhe favour'd another. Do you underſtand this, do you not think you are in <hi>Bedlam?</hi> were it not better for theſe poor Lovers freely to confeſs the debt, and inſtead of theſe Fooleries, wherewith every one amazes us in his turn, they ſhould joyn in one <hi>Chorus</hi> and ingeniouſly ſing.</p>
            <q>Tutti habbiamo di pazzia colma la teſta?</q>
            <p>Now to ſee if they act as they ſpeak; look upon thoſe there, that kiſs the Threſhold, crown it with Flowers, rub it with Perfumes; See thoſe that engrave a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand inſipid ſtories upon the Trees; thoſe, that read worſe in their Table-books. One, his arms croſt with grief, another skipping. But ſee that Wretch who poyſons himſelf, thoſe Rivals who kill one another. See
<q>Leandro in Mare, e Hero a la fineſtra.</q>See thoſe who have ruin'd their Health by a diſeaſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted in ours, and unknown to paſt Ages. In one word, they are for the moſt part without Wealth, without Reputation. In the mean time, ſee how they flatter their Tyrants, how they diſguiſe their Deformities, and though their Miſtreſſes be never ſo ugly, they make them Angels and Divinities. Let us reimbark, ſaid I 'tis not ſafe to remain long in an Iſland thus inhabited. Then you acknowledge, ſaid M. <hi>M.</hi> that 'tis dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to be amongſt Lovers, and that the habit is dangerous. I have heard ſay, that ordinarily we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:62940:28"/>thoſe we frequent, and that we are equally born good, but bad Company ruines us. But ſaith M. <hi>Ch.</hi> to me, do you think the matter goes, as our Friend ſays it does? What can I do, ſaid I, againſt ſo many Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples and Authorities? truly, if any thing keeps me yet on your ſide 'tis, that I have found you ſo Judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in all you hold, and you are ſo litte accuſtom'd to chooſe Opinions that are not good, that I am as yet wavering, and as the <hi>Italian</hi> ſays,
<q>Ne sì ne nò nel cuor mi ſuona intero.</q>But in the mean time, purſued I, methinks M. <hi>Trilport</hi> is a little Melancholy, as if he miſtruſted his cauſe. You ill explain my Seriouſneſs, replied M. <hi>Tr.</hi> and eſteem me a man of ſmall Courage; the truth is, if any thing ſtartles me, 'tis to ſee M. <hi>M.</hi> treating us like Children, to whom they ſhew painted Devils with Tails and Claws, and terrifying Faces, to make them afraid; for I do not believe, continued he, that you think Devils are ſo made, nor that you would go about with the Poet <hi>Bernia,</hi> to take the juſt length of their Horns and Tails. So M. <hi>M.</hi> with his Iſlands, his Imaginary pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, his Fabulous examples endeavours to fright us, and take us off from ſolid Reaſon. To what purpoſe is it to ſpeak of <hi>Agamemnon</hi> or of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> to know if a Young man ought to court Ladies? We ſhall ſee, ſays M. <hi>M.</hi> a little heated, what this ſolid Reaſon will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to in the caſe; but to let you ſee, if I ought to alledge <hi>Agamemnon</hi> or <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> whoſe Examples you believe ſuch ſtrangers to the queſtion, I demand of you, if this Induction is not reaſonable? If Love aſſembles in himſelf all the Defaults of Kings, of Hero's, of the gods of Fable; if Philoſophers, who I place above theſe Gods; if Men, who have excelled in Policy, in War, and paſs the reſt of Mankind, have fallen into
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:62940:28"/>theſe ſhameful Errours, when they became Amorous; if generally all Lovers are mad, may we not conclude, that a Young man who Loves will become imperfect and vicious, as other Lovers; nay, is more ſubject to theſe defects, than Kings, or Hero's, or Gods, or Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers, or Law-makers, or Conquerours, whoſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples we have been obliged to produce? though we have beſides ſtrengthned our Poſition with Authorities and Reaſons, the Image of <hi>Cupid,</hi> the Iſle of his Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, and the reſt which we have advanced. We ſhould do you wrong, ſaid I, in this matter to reproach you for having alledg'd any thing without proof; your diſcourſe in my opinion hath been much to the purpoſe: But to handle the Queſtion more fully, and to act entirely according to the taſte of your Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; will you not think it neceſſary to ſpeak ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of our Young Gentlemen and our Ladies, the Lovers and Miſtreſſes of our Times and Nation; of their Converſation and of their Courtſhip? for from things that are ſo familiar, and which we have every day before our eyes, 'twill be eaſie to ſee with which of the Opinions conteſted between you we ought to cloſe, and we may judge by the manners of our Lovers, whether we ought to fly or follow them. For my part, anſwers M. <hi>M.</hi> coldly, I ſhould think you might ſpare me this pains, which ſeems altogether needleſs; and after I have ſhew'd you, that generally all Lovers are extravagant, you cannot think our Nation more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt than others. And I am vext, continued He, that you did not acquaint me with your deſires before we weigh'd Anchor to come from the Amorous Iſland; for there I could have ſhew'd you a great many of thoſe people you enquire after, which yet are not diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to be met with elſewhere. But now we will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake no more Voyages, nor will we quit <hi>Paris.</hi> To proceed orderly, let us take our young Cavaliers,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:62940:29"/>who a few Months ſince left the Academy; and Sons of the City, Officers newly come to their charge. Let us imagine them Amorous, and by their Actions examine the qualities Love endows them with. Let the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men march firſt, that we may muſter up the good parts they have acquir'd with their Miſtreſſes: And firſt, to ſtudy their Converſation, we ſhall find it nor wiſe, nor ſolid, nor poliſh'd, nor gallant: What then? would you know? Let us draw near them, you ſhall hear nothing but a gibberiſh eternally repeated, compoſed of fifteen or twenty extraordinary words, which have a vogue in their Cabal, which they ſpeak improperly, and only to ſpeak them, without conſidering how they may cultivate their underſtandings; they ſpend in a quarter of an hour a number of Fooleries, which yet they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce with a Jeſting Authority, as if there were Salt in them; or ſome conceal'd myſtery. The Ladies in the mean time they laugh upon the publick Faith, as if they underſtood the ſubtleties; if they meet with any man, that will not quit Reaſons ſide to comply with them, God knows with what ſcorn they uſe him, and how he ſhall be handled in all places where theſe Star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins aſſemble to whiſtle. They believe nothing ſuch an enemy to wit as Silence; they infinitely eſteem their Judgment, which furniſhes them with deciſions for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing upon the place: In fine, by force of admiring one another, they are brought to think they are at the top of an agreeable converſation. And now we have exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd their Wit, which we find in pitiful plight, let us conſider their bravery. We ſhall quickly diſcover, that their higheſt deſign is to guild a Coach, or to vary a Livery, or as <hi>Malherbe</hi> ſays,
<q>
                  <l>Le perfum d'un colet,</l>
                  <l>Le point couppé d'un chemiſe,</l>
                  <l>Et la figure d'un balet.</l>
               </q>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:62940:29"/>We find them buſied, as Women, to dreſs and trick up themſelves, and with ſuch indecent Effiminacy, that 'tis left to us to divine not only, if they are Men, but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they ſeek not other men. In the mean time the preſumption of being Sparks gets up into their pates, they eſteem themſelves worth the Courtſhip of an <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazon</hi> Queen, and all run the ſame danger for their Beauty, which the <hi>Narciſſus</hi> of the Fable did. In this condition, they chooſe rather the Fortune of <hi>Paris,</hi> who was Fair as they, and poſſeſt <hi>Helen,</hi> than that of <hi>Ajax.</hi> But they merit the Reproach, which in <hi>Homer</hi> is given to this Original of Effeminateneſs,
<q>Laſche Paris au viſage tres-beau.</q>and deſerve to be treated as this Divine Poet handles this little Wanton, when amidſt ſo many thouſand Combatants he brings him in flying the Battel, to go lie with his Wife. From their Converſation and their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons let us paſs to their Manners. Amongſt other faults Libertiniſm offers it ſelf firſt: for, as their end is not to ſtop at a union of Wills and Hearts, but to proceed on, as they ſay, to ſomething more ſolid, they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy the utmoſt force of their Wits to debauch the Conſciences of Ladies by a pure malignity of Nature. Without having any occaſion to doubt, as learned Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertines have, they jeſt with Religion, they commit a hundred indecent actions in the Church. With five or ſix paſſages out of <hi>Charon</hi> and <hi>Montague,</hi> which the ableſt among them preach to the reſt, they pretend to overthrow all Divinity. The reſt of their Sentiments are nor noble nor high; they think nothing worthy the Vertue of their Anceſtors; the wings of Love cannot raiſe them to any generous thoughts; every day paſſes alike; the flower of their Lite ſlides away in a ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and unquiet Idleneſs, whilſt they are ſeated in their
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:62940:30"/>Chairs, extended in their Coaches, or bring diſorder into Families that receive them. But 'tis not in theſe times only, that ſuch kind of People make a trade of imbroiling Families; for you know, the <hi>Centaurs,</hi> the firſt Cavaliers of the World, came to the wedding of <hi>Perithous</hi> only to make Love, and by conſequence they diſturb'd the Feaſt. I ſhould be too long, if after the Gentleman I ſhould examine the Town-Child: I will content my ſelf to ſay by the by, he is one that believes himſelf an able man; that will talk Latin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt his Kinſwomen, and before his Miſtreſſes; that will judge of the Merit of his Rivals by their Money; that wanting Experience in the World, will want Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liteneſs and Agreement. In the mean time the Citizen and the Gentleman, governed by their Paſſions, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect all the duties of Life, ruine their Domeſtick affairs, abandon, together with their Friends, the thoughts of their Fortune, Honour, and Reputation, and render themſelves wholly deſpiſable; and all this for the Love of Ladies. According to this ſenſe, the <hi>Greeian</hi> Sculptors, whoſe Works often taught Morality, carv'd a <hi>Venus</hi> upon a Hee-Goat, thereby comparing a man ſubjected to the power of Women to this Animal, which is blindly led to all the unrulineſs of Love: but chiefly they were admirable for the invention of a Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, which they erected over the Tomb of that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Courtizan, who had ſeen all <hi>Greece</hi> on their knees before her Gate, and to whom they built a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre at <hi>Corinth,</hi> near to the Temple of <hi>Venus</hi> the <hi>Brown;</hi> theſe Maſters placed a Lioneſs emboſs'd, which tore in pieces a Ram. I ſhould never have done, ſhould I recount all the Errours of this Sex when they once fall in Love; and yet, if I would take the pains, 'twould amount to a great Argument againſt the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Opinion. For how can we conclude young men ſhould learn any thing that is good of perſons that are
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:62940:30"/>accompanied with nothing but Vanity, Weakneſs, Ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality, Treachery; that have nothing ſincere, nothing great; who have double Hearts, counterfeit Faces and Actions? Would it not rather draw to a conſequence, that theſe Young men by converſing with Women, ſhould loſe all ſeeds of Goodneſs, and all inclination which their Souls might have to Vertue? Nor is it this Vertue Women ſeek for; they ſtill chooſe the worſt; <hi>Venus</hi> leaves <hi>Mars</hi> for <hi>Adonis; Helena Menelaus</hi> for <hi>Paris;</hi>— You are in a fair way, cries M. <hi>Ch.</hi> and if we let you go on, 'tis very likely you will not ſtop in haſte: for you take a marvellous pleaſure in this Story, and I foreſee ſomething very odd like to ſcape you, if I do not prevent the Storm. You have reaſon, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued M. <hi>M.</hi> and to tell you true, if you had not hindred me, I was ſtrangely tempted to tell you the Story of <hi>Giocondo,</hi> and the Matron of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> with others of that nature. Reſerve thoſe to another time, replies M. <hi>Ch.</hi> and I am not of opinion, you ought any longer to give way to your Choler; and to ſpare you an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable pains, you may remember, if you pleaſe, that when we enquir'd of you concerning thoſe pretended Maximes you attributed to Ladies, we did not ask for the Dialogues of <hi>Lucian</hi>'s Courtizans, nor <hi>Juvenal</hi>'s ſixteenth Satyr, nor the life of <hi>Celeſtina:</hi> we would have you tell us of <hi>Artemiſia, Penelope, Lucretia.</hi> I take you at your word, ſays M. <hi>M.</hi> on condition you will not except againſt theſe Teſt monies you have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, and that you will judge of Women upon the depoſitions of <hi>Artemiſia, Penelope,</hi> and <hi>Lucretia;</hi> and that after this you will be content I end a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, which in my opinion hath no need of further proof. For <hi>Artemiſia,</hi> continued he, I know no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd Goſſip that would not be aſhamed of the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of this Queen: I do not ſpeak of thoſe which her affection cauſed; they were juſt, they were honeſt;
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:62940:31"/>and if her grief had ſtifled her, whilſt ſhe complains of fortune, when ſhe drown'd her face in tears, and ſaid againſt the ſtars, what could be ſaid:
<q>
                  <l>Tout ce que fait dire la rage,</l>
                  <l>Quand elle eſt Maiſtreſſe des Sens.</l>
               </q>I ſay, if ſhe had expir'd then, it may be that to this time her Friendſhip would be as much a marvel as her <hi>Mauſoleum.</hi> But by misfortune ſhe buried her Grief, for the loſs of her Husband, with his Aſhes; and this vain and pompous oſtentation of Conjugal union quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gave place to a ſecond Paſſion, which tranſported her to kill her ſelf. <hi>Scaliger,</hi> upon the fame of an ancient Author, informs us, that this Queen fell in love with a young man of <hi>Abidas,</hi> call'd <hi>Dardanus,</hi> and to revenge her ſelf of his coldneſs, ſhe ſurpriz'd him ſleeping, and did tear out his eyes; but that her Revenge did not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh her Paſſion, its violence forcing her to throw her ſelf from the Rocks of <hi>Leucadia,</hi> ſhe dy'd of the fall. As for <hi>Penelope, Seneca</hi> avows, that he found ſo much concerning her affection, <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con,</hi> that he durſt not conclude, whether ſhe were a ſinner or an honeſt Woman. Another Author leſs ſolid, but very witty, hath an unlucky conceit about the continual Feaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in her Houſe amidſt a crowd of Gallants, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprets maliciouſly the trial of her Husbands Bow. And to take away all doubt, <hi>Pauſanias</hi> aſſures us, that in his time there paſt an ancient Poem, which recount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed how <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes,</hi> when he return'd from the Siege of <hi>Troy,</hi> beat her out of doors; and that there was a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition then currant amongſt the <hi>Mantineans,</hi> that <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelope</hi> fled to their Town and died there. Laſtly, What can we judge of <hi>Lucretia,</hi> but with M. <hi>L.</hi> that ſhe kill'd her ſelf after the fact? Thus by ſearching things to the bottom, we ſee that the moſt part of theſe Beauties,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:62940:31"/>who appear fierce and cold, as the ancient <hi>Sabines,</hi> have often no advantage over the reſt, but that of diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling well; and all theſe Heroin's, which in <hi>Auſonius</hi> threatned to crucifie <hi>Cupid,</hi> at the inſtance of <hi>Venus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd his puniſhment to a whipping with Roſes. Let us not then abuſe our ſelves in a belief, that Women can inſpire generous thoughts; but rather think their Beauty corrupts our Judgments, making us believe, their Converſation is as profitable as we find it pleaſant. Let us ſtill remember, that this Beauty, whereupon the moſt of them would raiſe a legitimate domination, is no other, according to <hi>Socrates,</hi> but a ſhort Tyranny; and that <hi>Sophocles</hi> often repeated in his Old age, that he eſteem'd himſelf very happy in that he had ſhaken off the yoak of this Amorous tyranny. But we will end with the Advice of <hi>Thales,</hi> and admire the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel he gave a miſerable wretch, asking what he ſhould do to free himſelf from Love; he firſt adviſed him to faſt; and when a Diet would not ſerve, he perſwaded him to expect his health from Time and Abſence; but after many months and a long perigrination, ſeeing that Hunger, Diſtance, and Time were too weak Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, he ordain'd him to Hang himſelf. I have ſaid. Seeing M. <hi>Menage</hi> had done, you have, ſaid I, handled Lovers, as one adviſed a maker of Romances to handle his principal perſon, when he would needs perſwade him, that he could not find out an event, nor more new nor more ſurprizing, than to cauſe him be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly hang'd. In this at leaſt I am excuſable, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered M. <hi>M.</hi> which is, That I have been content to open the cauſe, and to let the Sentence be pronounc'd by another. On the contrary, replied I, 'tis to be feared you have acted with malice, and have brought in this Philoſopher, that his Sentence might be as authentick as that of a Judge. That may be, added M. <hi>Trilport,</hi> but there is a remedy for it, and I declare to you, ſays
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:62940:32"/>he, addreſſing himſelf to M. <hi>M.</hi> that I appeal from your Sage to ours. And from <hi>Thales</hi> to M. <hi>Chappelein</hi> is <hi>à minori,</hi> ſays M. <hi>M.</hi> Stop there, replies M. <hi>Ch.</hi> I muſt interrupt you, leſt you ſhould think I agree and confeſs my ſelf a Sage, which God forbid. But, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued he, addreſſing himſelf to M. <hi>M.</hi> though I am to plead the Cauſe of Lovers, your ſelf ſhall be the Judge. You hold your Cauſe very good then, ſays M. <hi>M.</hi> ſeeing you are content to be Judg'd by your Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary. As good as your Conſcience, continued M. <hi>Ch.</hi> and I believe you ſo juſt, and find my Cauſe ſo ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in equity, that I declare, I ſhall be content with what you ſhall pronounce, after you have heard me. We here were ſilent, and after ſome moments M. <hi>Ch.</hi> begun: If I do not lend to your Opinion that full conſent you could wiſh, you ought not to complain 'tis for want of attention. I have hearkned to your diſcourſe with an intire application, and truly, you have ſo ingeniouſly ſpoken againſt Love, that if I had not been bound with the Cords of Truth, you had perverted me: but at laſt I am, as a ſeeond <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes,</hi> eſcap'd from the danger of the <hi>Sirenes,</hi> after having been charm'd with their Songs. Whatever enchantments, for all that, you have pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed to prove the opinion ſuſtained by you; I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to let you ſee, that, if I am not deceiv'd, the contrary is the better; wiſhing paſſionately, that in this cauſe you would act better than the <hi>Medea</hi> of <hi>Euripides</hi> and <hi>Ovid,</hi> and that after you have ſeen and approved the Truth, I ſhall declare, you do not remain the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of a hereſie, that cannot appear fair, but becauſe you paint it. I ſhall act clearly with you, anſwering what you have advanc'd point by point; ſhewing, if I can, the falſeneſs or the weakneſs of them. I will alſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate my ſelf to your way of Philoſophizing, which is without doubt the moſt proper for a Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, and of which I ſhall willingly ſerve my ſelf,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:62940:32"/>becauſe it is not ſo ſevere as that which is commonly practiſed; but is not leſs ſtrong for being more deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate: and gently to draw out a confeſſion is better, than to do it by putting a knife to the throat. So that I ſhall continue to baniſh from our diſcourſe theſe Syllogiſms of the Schools, which make their heads giddy that ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to comprehend and reſolve them. We will not take Love from amidſt the Graces, to put him into the hands of Diſputants: and I will take care, that our Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, which hath hitherto been ſweet and eaſie, does not degenerate into the querulous noiſe of two Maſters of Art. You began your accuſation with explaining a Figure, whereby you would ſcare us, as M. <hi>Tr.</hi> well noted; and if we ſhould believe you, you have placed Love, which is the ſweeteſt bond of Humane Society, in the number of <hi>Harpies</hi> and other Monſters of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity: I will preſently examine, if this Picture be as good as it is common; I will content my ſelf in the mean time to let you know, that 'tis capable of recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving quite another ſenſe to that you have given it; and that there is nothing but vertuous in this piece, which you ſet out as if all the defects, which Humane frailty can ſuffer, were aſſembled in it. To proceed orderly, you pretend, that this Child notes the weakneſs and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther imperfections of that age. But, if it were ſo, the moſt Learned Painters are much in the wrong to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent him as they do, holding Lions under his ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and Poets were no leſs to blame for ſhewing him in their works, ſnatching the Thunderbolt from the hand of <hi>Jove,</hi> and exerciſing his power on his Mother. And thoſe of <hi>Cytherea</hi> believed, that this <hi>Venus,</hi> who drew all her power from Love, preſided in War; and the <hi>Cypriots</hi> figur'd her with a Launce; others repreſented her Statue arm'd; yea, the <hi>Romans</hi> built a Temple to <hi>Venus</hi> the Victorious. The Prudence of Love is as ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily juſtified as his Force: and we cannot doubt of it, if
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:62940:33"/>we will remember, that he unravell'd the firſt confuſion of the Univerſe, and that we may attribute to him with the <hi>Italian</hi> Poet,
<q>Penſier canuti in giovenit etade.</q>We muſt not then accuſe Old people for being in Love, provided their thoughts reſemble thoſe of this Boy. But we muſt agree on the point, that Love is painted Young only to let us ſee what we are about to conclude, That Love is neceſſary to Youth. And 'tis almoſt the ſame reaſon, which <hi>Agathon</hi> in the Divine Philoſopher urges to prove that Love is young; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, ſaith he, he is alwaies ſound amongſt Young people. But this Boy, ſay you, is impudent to go al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies naked. 'Tis true what you ſay, that 'twere a foul action to ſtrip ones ſelf in the open Market, but you advance little by this; for not only this is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies true, for the <hi>Dacedemonian</hi> Boys and Girles were naked together in the place of their Exerciſes, and that under a diſcipline the moſt auſtere in the World; but further, though your Rule ſhould be general, 'twould not follow, that Impudency were a vice of Childhood, none ever ſaid ſo: nor that Shameleſsneſs, which is a ſign of this defect, and which proceeds alwaies from a long cuſtome of filthy and bold actions, is figur'd by Childhood. Far from this, we are pleas'd with thoſe Pictures of the people wherewith we adorn our Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and wherewith we repreſent Angels. And you would be more ſcrupulous than our devout Matrons, who are not yet aware of being ſcandaliz'd at theſe nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities. As to the Teſtimony of <hi>Euſtatius,</hi> which you alledge, if I remember right, it means nothing but the firſt boldneſs of Lovers, and ought rather to be taken for a piece of Courtſhip, than an injury. Nay, this Biſhop ſo little thought of charging Love with Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:62940:33"/>for his Nakedneſs, that he writes this God is naked only, that he may dive into the water to preſerve the ſpecies of Fiſh. And in one place of his Romance, <hi>Iſmenias</hi> ſeeing his Miſtreſs throw her ſelf into the Sea, prays <hi>Cupid</hi> to dive after her, and bring her up again. By this we may eaſily judge, that the Nakedneſs of Love ought not to be explain'd in a bad ſenſe, as you do, and that it ſignifies nothing leſs than his Impudence; and thoſe who have ſpoken of it without Paſſion, have given it a ſenſe different from yours. Whether they have concluded with <hi>Antiphanes,</hi>
               <q>Que l'on ne peut cacher l'amout, qui va tout nud.</q>or whether, according to the Opinion of others, this Love thus expoſes his Beauty to ſhew, that he diſallows of all artifices wherewith Beauty is ſet off. And, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this ſenſe, the <hi>Jupiter</hi> of <hi>Homer</hi> ſharply chides <hi>Juno</hi> for ſtealing the Girdle of <hi>Venus,</hi> to the end that ſhe might augment his flames: or whether this Nakedneſs ſignifies, that the thoughts of Lovers ought to be ſo noble, that they may expoſe them without a Veil to the ſight of all the World: or laſtly, whether this god is minded to ſhew his exceeding force in this weak eſtate. You will come off no better, I believe, in your interpretation of his Ribband. You take it for a hoodwink'd reaſon, whereby our minds are caſt into darkneſs worſe than <hi>Cymerian,</hi> and which hinders us even from diſcerning what is good Manners. I could here object to you, that you had forgot they call the Eyes the Guides of Love: but I will not ſerve my ſelf of this Opinion, becauſe I diſapprove it, and am of that of the Queen <hi>Olympias,</hi> who accuſed a Young man for want of Wit, becauſe he married only by the counſel of his Eyes; I will only ſay then, that our Underſtanding never is more awake nor more
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:62940:34"/>active, than when we love and have ambition to pleaſe. And in this matter I ſend you to <hi>Ovid,</hi> who compares the vigilancy of Lovers to that of Captains. But in my opinion, the true explication of this Ribband, which we might call a Diadem, if we would defend our ſelves with as much paſſion as you accuſe us with; the beſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, I ſay, is to imagine, that <hi>Venus</hi> is willing his Theſts ſhould be conceal'd, as one of the Ancients plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly ſaid; and that Diſcretion is the beſt quality, not only of Lovers, but of men the moſt debauch'd. You are not ignorant, that the <hi>Italians</hi> fay, Diſcretion <hi>ſtaben ſin al</hi>—pardon me the reſt, and permit me to paſs on to the Wings, Arrows, and Torch. For his Wings, I confeſs in this Article your railleries are very pleaſant, and there is much wit in the Conceits of our Friends, but we will take them, if you pleaſe, only for Jeſts, and not accept of their Teſtimonies in other manner, than as you intended to ſpend them, and let you know in the mean time, that they who firſt invented theſe Wings would teach us, that ous Deſires and Thoughts ought to raiſe themſelves up to Heaven, and not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies grovel upon the Earth. For his Arrows, I can eaſily approve of thoſe reflexions you made; but, to judge wholſomly, your Invective only ſtrikes at the ill uſe of Love: and theſe two ſorts of Arrows do only note the ſecret motions to inclination or hatred, which we find in our ſelves, but not the Cauſes which give thoſe motions, and leaſt of all any thing of Avarice or Preſents. For in all the Children, which ever pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from the marriage of <hi>Theagines</hi> and <hi>Chariclea,</hi> that is, in all the Romances that ever were, from the <hi>Ethiopick</hi> Hiſtory to the Grand <hi>Cyrus,</hi> is there any thing ſo handſom or ſo frequent, as that ſcorn wherein Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers hold Greatneſs, Crowns, Treaſures, only to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve their Fidelity to miſerable and exil'd perſons, who groan under Irons, and have no other advantage, beſides
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:62940:34"/>their Merit and their Paſſion? Nothing therefore can better ſet out theſe noble, elevated, and generous Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments than to ſay, that their Souls are really wounded with a Golden ſhaft; and that to deſtroy theſe illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Prerogatives of Heaven, all the Treaſures of the Earth are leaden arms, which bend and cannot pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate. <hi>Merlins</hi> Fountains, whereof <hi>Ariſto</hi> makes his Knights to drink, and whoſe ſcurce <hi>Claudian</hi> found be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, confirm what we fay. They were both of a like Water, and without the advantage to murmur o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Golden duſt, as <hi>Pactolus</hi> and <hi>Tagus,</hi> they did glide peaceably over the ſame Sand, and one gave a violent averſion, the other a violent paſſion. <hi>Ovid,</hi> who for the moſt part explains ingenuouſly the nature of theſe Arrows, when he ſpeaks of the Golden ones, does not give us the leaſt ſuſpicion, that he thought of Preſents, no not thoſe of his age, which were Fruits, Noſegays, and Perſumes. It only reſts, that we ſpeak of his Torch, which you compare to that of the Furies, for which I am much tempted to accuſe you of Impiety; and, I think, I could not ſay too much againſt a man, who ſo ill handles a fire, that we may call the Soul of the World, which actuates and conſerves all that has any ſenſe in the Univerſe, and without which the face of Nature would appear wild and deſolate. But becauſe I would not quarrel you, and that I endeavour to perſwade you without diſpleaſing you; I conjure you, that we may underſtand this matter aright, to caſt your eyes upon the effects of this Torch, and do not ſear it will trouble your fight, as thoſe diſmal Torches of Nights three Daughters,
<q>
                  <l>Mira d'intorno, Sylvio,</l>

                  <l>Opra è d'amore. Amante è il cielo; amante</l>

               </q>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:62940:35"/>You know what follows in the <hi>Paſtor fido</hi> of <hi>Guarini,</hi> and how he carries it even to Animals and Trees, which feel the ſweet warmth of this fire: believe me, this fire hath in it ſomething Divine; and the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> who (compar'd with their Wiſdom) eſteem'd that of the <hi>Greeks</hi> but Boys play, when they would expreſs Love, did it only by Fire, as the pureſt and nobleſt E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lement. Now, as you, after your malicious explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Loves Figure, conclude with him in <hi>Atheneus,</hi> that the gods did well to baniſh him Heaven: I alſo, having given the true ſenſe of it am bold to ſay, that <hi>Heſiod, Solon</hi> and <hi>Plato,</hi> never ſhew'd more Wiſdom, than when they took Love from the Mountain of <hi>Heli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con,</hi> to lead him into the Academy adorn'd and crown'd with Flowers; in the midſt of Muſick and Sacrifices, to conſtitute him Director and Maſter. From what I have ſaid you may conclude, that my Praiſes make a more reaſonable Picture of Love, than your Invectives; and that the ſame matter, which hath ſerv'd you for his Accuſation, is very proper to make his Panegyrick. But becauſe the ſenſe of this Picture may yet remain a Problem to obſtinate Wits, we will not abide by it; beſides, 'tis much conteſted, and divers Learned men are not of accord with the Vulgar opinion. <hi>Theodorus,</hi> in <hi>Plato</hi>'s Banquet, mocks at thoſe who make a Child of this god; which he eſteems the moſt Ancient of all the gods, not excepting <hi>Saturn.</hi> Another <hi>Greek</hi> in his Hue and Cry for the ſugitive Love, far from thinking him blind, ſays, he has moſt penetrating Eyes, and takes this mark for ſo true a one, that he gives it to know him by, that, if they met him, they ſhould bring him home. <hi>Euſtatius</hi> faſtens thoſe Wings to his Heels, which the common Opinion puts upon his Shoulders: <hi>Eubulus</hi> in <hi>Atheneus</hi> goes further, and will allow him no Wings, but ſays, that the Painters, who invented them, were ignorant Fellows, and fit only to paint Swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows:
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:62940:35"/>Another, in the ſame Author, gives him two Bows: In fine, <hi>Propertius</hi> ſaith, Love was born in the Fields, and that his Bow and Arrows were only for the chafe of Wild Beaſts. Theſe, as you ſee, contradict the common Image of Love: <hi>Moſebus</hi> adds, that his Body is of Flame-colour, his Hair frizeld, his Look malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, his Hands ſmall, and concludes with the reſt, that he is a right dangerous Archer. If we ſhould add the fantaſtical Conceits of ſome Modern <hi>Spaniards</hi> to the Inventions of the Ancient <hi>Greeks,</hi> I could furniſh you with one <hi>Criſtova,</hi> who in his Verſes ſtrives to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, that Love is perfectly like the Great <hi>Turk.</hi> This reſemblance, ſays M. <hi>Menage,</hi> is very extraordinary; but I know one that will no leſs ſurprize you, and yet it is of the Old Rock: for what ſay you when you read in <hi>Macrobius,</hi> that the <hi>Cypriots,</hi> who ought to know <hi>Venus,</hi> erected a Statue, which repreſented her with a Beard? After we had laugh'd a little, leaving, continued M. <hi>Ch.</hi> theſe Repreſentations, which make little to the Queſtion, I will come to <hi>Plutarchs</hi> Opinion, who aſſures us, that Love is not viſible; and will fay, with one of the Ancient <hi>Comicks,</hi> that Painters and Sculptors did not know what Love was; for, as he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geniouſly adds, Love is neither Male nor Female; God nor Man; Wiſe nor Fooliſh; but he is made up of all theſe, and aſſembles many different ſpecies under one Figure, which hath the boldneſs of a Man, the fearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Women; is ſerious in his Folly, circumſpect in his Rage; which ſuffers the tranſports of Wild Beaſts, and labour cannot tame him; of a wild Ambition, bringing no leſs Diſcord along with him, than we ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine in Hell; who is capable of things Serious, of things Peacable, of things Violent. You ſay more than I could deſire, ſaid M. <hi>Menage,</hi> and to ſave you trouble in examining the reſt of my Diſcourſe, I will joyn iſſue with you here. Your Cauſe w'ont be the better
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:62940:36"/>for it, anſwers M. <hi>Ch.</hi> and I ſhall not fail to reply to the reſt. But that we may ſee to the utmoſt, what we ought to conclude concerning Love, and rigorouſly to examine the Good and the Evil that may be alledged, I will add <hi>Plato</hi>'s Teſtimony, who calls Love a cruel Monſter, that has as many Heads as <hi>Hydra.</hi> I will add that of <hi>Sophocles,</hi> who ſays, <hi>Venus</hi> is not only <hi>Venus,</hi> but <hi>Pluto,</hi> Neceſſity, Rage, Covetouſneſs, Grief. I will add that of <hi>Plutarch,</hi> who conſidering that Love does Cheriſh and Hate, Follow and Fly, Threaten and Pray, is Angry and feels Compaſſion, is Sad and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyces, Will and Will not; and all this at one time and for the ſame perſon, concludes, 'tis not a thing very Judicious, but an imbroil'd Enigma, and of difficult Interpretation. If this is not enough, we will continue the deſcription of <hi>Moſchus,</hi> which we began, and ſay, that Loves Thoughts are malicious, his Words flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, his Diſcourſe contrary to his meaning; that he hath a ſweet Voice, is mad in his Anger, a Deceiver and a Fool; and in all his ſportings hath ſome Black de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign. And this is enough fully to perſwade you, that I have betray'd my Cauſe, and that you have gained yours; or at leaſt, that I act too ſincerely with you, producing Teſtimonies which you know well, but had forgot, and which alone ſeem capable to convince me. But, as you very well remark'd at the entrance of your Diſcourſe, that the firſt Poets did Philoſophize, and then you plac'd me upon <hi>Parnaſſus;</hi> from a place ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent, which my Modeſty durſt not pretend to, ſuffer me to reaſon with you in a few words, and till then ſuſpend, if you pleaſe, your Judgment of what good or ill you and I have delivered concerning Love. I ſay then, that all things which we poſſeſs, let them be never ſo good, or whatever praiſes they deſerve, become evil when they paſs the bounds of their perfection; whether it be exceſs or defect that draws them. For
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:62940:36"/>Example, Prudence, which is that that Mankind ought moſt paſſionately to covet, and which indeed is the greateſt giſt that God doth beſtow upon Man, becomes viſionary and fanatical when it is too much refin'd, and in this condition is no leſs dangerous, than Folly. 'Tis the ſame in other Vertues, whoſe extreams are never wholſom; good Senſe only is that which moderates them; and all the advantage which perſons have we call Vertuous, is, the knowledge of the true meaſure to which they ought to reduce their good qualities. 'Tis the ſame in Love; and therefore <hi>Plutarch</hi> writes, that <hi>Erato,</hi> one of the Muſes, did preſide over it for its regulation. When it is at the top of its perfection, there are no praiſes which it does not merit: When it paſſes its limits, it is worthy of all the blame you and I have alledg'd. <hi>Greece,</hi> as amorous as it was of <hi>Lais,</hi> mock'd at thoſe who brought a Talent to this Courtizan to paſs a Night with her; but the inſenſibility of <hi>Zenocrates</hi> was no better handled by them, when he compar'd her to a piece of Wood. Hence you may collect, 'tis not that regulated Love about which we contend, that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors have ſaid ſo much ill of, but that Love which our exceſs depraves, and which we are ready to blame as well as you. The better to comprehend the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between theſe Loves, learned Antiquity acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd two <hi>Venus's;</hi> one Celeſtial, the other Vulgar: The firſt they call'd <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rania,</hi> the other <hi>Pandeme,</hi> or the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> of the Common people. And they had each of them their Love, whereof one was govern'd by the Muſes, the other, according to the teſtimony of a <hi>Greek</hi> Poet, durſt not approach them; the firſt was free from all violent Troubles, the other was the Father of Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: that was for Wiſe men; this, for Fools. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this ſenſe one Judiciouſly ſaid, Wiſe men Love, but others deſire; whereby he would ſignifie, that the advantage of knowing how to love was reſerv'd for the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:62940:37"/>Vertuous, leaving to the Multitude all the Misfortunes that follow irregular Paſſions. But what defect is it, you will here ſay to me, that makes the moſt part of Mankind ſtray from this happy Love, and which caſts them upon the furies and griefs of the bad <hi>Venus?</hi> 'Tis not one Error, I muſt anſwer, but all thoſe which carry them from the poſſeſſion of other good qualities. Yet in my opinion a principal cauſe of the Diſorders of thoſe who love is, they imbark themſelves in this Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion before they have choſen, whence finding humors contrary to their own, or unruly minds, their life muſt paſs in diſquiets, or they muſt abandon themſelves to that diſorder, which they purſu'd without any fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight. Doubtleſs here ſome one cannot forbear to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the half Loadſtone, which <hi>Plato</hi> ſays we have at our firſt Creation, which is not without trouble till 'tis joyn'd to the other moiety from whence 'twas broken off; for my part, I pretend to pay you with currant Money, and to diſcourſe more roundly than thoſe that nouriſh themſelves with <hi>Idea's.</hi> I ſay then, that when Eſteem precedes Love, and that we judge of the object before we engage our Paſſion, Love becomes one of the greateſt advantages we have. <hi>Bertaut,</hi> according to this ſenſe, of all the Errors we commit in Love con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns chiefly that of failing in the election, as the ſource of all the reſt, when he ſays,
<q>
                  <l>Car enfin la faute, qui naiſt</l>
                  <l>D'aymer ce, qui n'eſt point aymable:</l>
                  <l>Et de n'aymer point ce qui l'eſt,</l>
                  <l>Eſt ſeul in amour condamnable.</l>
               </q>You ſee, that to this he adds another in favour of the good Love, and which he thinks no leſs an Error, it is, not to love that which deſerves Love. Accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting himſelf in this to <hi>Ovids</hi> Opinion, who in his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:62940:37"/>exhorts thoſe who have choſen well to continue with conſtancy, and, finding their happineſs conſiſts in their Paſſion, he adviſes them to make good uſe of their Joy, and to ſpread all their Sails, and ſays, he looks upon them as upon thoſe, who enter'd victorious into the Capitol. Now you will confeſs with me, that the Common people, for the moſt part ſubject to their firſt motions, and almoſt incapable of reflection, have not this good diſcerning, eſpecially in a thing where they truſt their Eyes and Senſe of the matter, whence we conclude, that 'tis no wonder they fall into diſaſters, which themſelves procure, and that what is ſaid againſt Love does not reſpect that of Wiſe men, but of the Vulgar, who corrupt it by their bad uſe of it; I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not better conclude this diſcourſe; nor leave with you a more pleaſant Idea, than the Opinion which the <hi>Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi> had, they who profeſt a Vertue ſo rigid, which is, That when <hi>Venus</hi> paſs'd the River <hi>Eurotas</hi> to preſent her ſelf to <hi>Licurgus</hi> their Lawgiver, ſhe left upon the the Banks her Girdle full of Charms, her Glaſs, and all her wanton Robes, which drew in part the adoration of the reſt of the World, and appear'd before this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Man with a Helmet upon her head, her hand is charg'd with a Launce and Buckler. Let us apply this, and we ſhall find that Love, which repreſents it ſelf to Common men with all thoſe ſalſe Beauties that deceive and ruine them, lays by theſe pernicious Inchantments when he approaches the Wiſe; or rather, that 'tis the Vulgar who dreſs up Love in this attire, Idolizing him becauſe they do not know him, and following him down Precipices; whereas Gallant men ſtrip him to re-cloath him with Ornaments proper for him, and give him that perfection, which is the happineſs of thoſe who know how to love: Now as thoſe who write to reform the Manners of men, do not aim at theſe Wiſe men we ſpeak of, becauſe they have no need of Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrances,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:62940:38"/>and make up the leaſt part of Mankind; we need not wonder, if thoſe who diſcourſe of Love, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it in that deplorable condition to which 'tis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd in the hands of the People, and if to divert or cure this multitude, loſt in its own Folly, they have ſtudied to deſcribe it hideous, and capable of making men miſerable: and yet as monſtrous a thing as they have repreſented it to be, you ſhall ſee that they ſtill mixt ſome good, yea, in ſuch a degree, that often its excellent qualities ſurmount the bad. Whence we may be bold to determine, that Love is alwaies good in it ſelf, that we can accuſe nothing but the diſorders that happen in it, and that they are theſe vulgar Lovers who have thus disfigur'd it. And I ſhall by and by let you ſee, that they have handled that of Wiſe men better. In the mean time, upon this foundation, which I aſſure my ſelf you will find ſolid and reaſonable, it will be eaſie for me to build the Anſwers I am to make, and to defend my ſelf from all thoſe Examples wherewith you are arm'd. I will add only two things to this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, whereof you ſhall grant me one, unleſs you would have me convince you by your ſelf, which are, That all the exaggerations in the diſcourſe of Lovers ſerve as well to ſhew the quickneſs of their wit, as the force of their paſſion: and that there are certain things in uſe, which have a good grace in certain places, which we ſhould be unjuſt to condemn, though they are not cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant amongſt us, otherwiſe we muſt expect the like; and we ſhould draw towards the exceſs of preſumption, if we eſteem our ſelves enough to believe, that our Laws and Cuſtomes ought to be the rule of thoſe of Mankind. I come now to a particular examination of the reſt of your diſcourſe, after you have aggravated Loves faults, the better to make it good, you paſs to Examples. Which at firſt ſight ſeem to have ſomewhat of weight in them; for you bring upon the Stage the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:62940:38"/>great <hi>Atrides,</hi> the valiant <hi>Achilles,</hi> the ſtout <hi>Hercules,</hi> and at laſt <hi>Jupiter</hi> himſelf, which is all that Fable hath of Noble. For the firſt, which are the People of the <hi>Iliads,</hi> I would joyn iſſue with you, if inſtead of <hi>Agamemnon</hi> and <hi>Achilles</hi> you would produce <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes.</hi> But I will take theſe three, the better to confirm by them what I have advanc'd, That there is a great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the Love of Common people, and the Love of Sages, that we as much blame the firſt, as we approve the other, and that almoſt all your Examples lie againſt that which we find fault with. <hi>Horace,</hi> whoſe Cenſures are very regular, when he writes his opinion of <hi>Homers</hi> two Poems, notes well, that the War of the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Barbarians</hi> contain'd only the Paſſions of mad Princes and fooliſh People. That in the Camp and in the Town all was full of Sedition, Deceit, Cruelty, Rage, and bruitiſh Senſuality; and that the Souldiers ſuffer'd through the Folly of their Princes. Coming afterwards to conſider the Odyſſes, he ſaith, that the Poet hath propos'd <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> for a perfect and profitable Example of all, that Prudence, Wiſdom, and Vertue can do. So that you need not wonder, if <hi>Agamemnon</hi> and his Rival had their tranſports in Love; they whoſe whole life was irregular, and who, in all they did, never conſulted their Reaſon, nor took counſel, but of their Will and their Power. After this diſcourſe of <hi>Horace,</hi> we may rank their Examples among the Vulgar, and ought to judge of them according to <hi>Seneca</hi>'s Opinion, That Merit and not Dignity, ſeparates us from the crowd. If we return to <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes,</hi> we may conſider, that in his greateſt Misfortunes he hath had ſome little Loves, by which the Poet ſeems to inſinuate, that a Wiſe man ought alwaies to make Love. But in all his Loves we find nothing diſorderly, nothing defective, nothing which does not ſet him off with ſome advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, nothing in fine, which were not to be wiſh'd.
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:62940:39"/>And now let us come to <hi>Hercules,</hi> and without ſeeking to excuſe him, as we might, let us place him amongſt this crowd, that goes aſtray. And indeed all thoſe who have exalted his Strength, have had but a bad opinion of his mind; and ſuch as have reported the great Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices he did the World, have defam'd him as a Mad man, and one who fill'd his own Houſe with horrible Spectacles. There remains only <hi>Jupiter</hi> to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by us, and with him, if you pleaſe, all the gods of Antiquity; if we look upon them as men, we muſt ſay, that they have preferr'd Violence to Equity, and abus'd their Power in their Paſſions. Or if you will, that we treat them as Immortal gods, it muſt be on condition, that we remember Antiquity, which has learnt us their Loves, far from blaming them, have had them in veneration, and that ſhe has made her greateſt Myſteries out of the moſt ridiculous Adventures; that ſhe hath rais'd upon Altars and peopled Heaven with theſe Generations, and that among the <hi>Egyptians</hi> we find ſtately rooms of <hi>Jupiters</hi> Miſtreſſes. Thus, you cannot draw conſequences diſadvantagious to us from the Examples of theſe Men-gods, ſeeing that as Men we hold, that in their Loves they are capable of all the weakneſſes of the Common people; and that as Gods, we ought not to reduce the Religion of Pagans to our Reaſon, who invented theſe Fooleries to conſecrate them. You ſee now, that you have got little by theſe Examples, that we blame the Faults of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple as well as you, but that they have nothing propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable to that Love which we preferr. And now you lead in <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle;</hi> great Names, and worthy of a great Reſpect; and we are ſo far from preſuming to cenſure their Actions, that on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary we are ready to take them for the Model of our own. They have Lov'd, ſay you; we believe a Wiſe man ought to do it. But during their Gallantry they
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:62940:39"/>wrote Verſes, and did things unbeſeeming their Gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Let us ſee, if in this they did not allow ſomething to the Mode of their Countrey, and if upon a matter indifferent in their Cuſtomes they have not ſuffer'd their Genius to ſport it ſelf. You know how far <hi>Greece</hi> once countenanc'd Love: And you know that <hi>Socrates,</hi> who taught Morality to other men, taught Love to <hi>Alcibia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des;</hi> and that amongſt the Works of Philoſophers in thoſe Ages there was ſtill ſome ſtrain of Love. Now, Love then was accompanied with Poeſie, and the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes were alwaies preſent at <hi>Greek</hi> Feaſts. <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſays, That in his time men did not ceaſe to Love, though they made no Verſes; as if before, theſe two had been inſeparable. But theſe Nine Siſters did not accompany Lovers with that ſeverity, which they aſſum'd for the Hymns of the gods; they came attended by <hi>Bacchus</hi> and <hi>Ceres,</hi> dreſt, perfum'd, and merry; they came, as we find them in the Poetry of <hi>Sappho, Anacreon,</hi> and other <hi>Lyricks,</hi> celebrating, amidſt Wine and garlands of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, the Beauty and Wit of thoſe they Lov'd. And this being ſo, can you think it ſtrange that theſe Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers follow'd the faſhion of their Countrey in Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which the Manners of their Nation and Age not only made lawful, but which were ſo eſteem'd, that the wiſe <hi>Solon,</hi> who alſo made Love-Verſes, forbids Slaves to make Love, reſerving this honour for Free men? Are you offended, that in making Verſes they ſerv'd themſelves of the ſame Praiſes, and us'd the ſame Language with other Poets, that they employ'd the Sun, the Stars, and the reſt of the compariſons of Beauty? If you are not yet ſatisfied, but will continue to blame thoſe tranſports of Love, which <hi>Plato</hi> ſhew'd for <hi>Dion,</hi> I will anſwer, that 'twas Rapture carried him to the expreſſion, but that he did not feel in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf all that he ſaid, nor did think his Verſe ſhould one day be examin'd by ſo ſevere a Judge as your ſelf.
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:62940:40"/>And for the Kiſs of <hi>Agathon,</hi> without examining <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi> Manners, let it ſatisfie us that the World then found no fault with it; nor will we inſiſt upon the reaſon he had to love <hi>Archianaſſa,</hi> the Wiſdom of that Woman charm'd him, and his conceit of Love hid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der wrinckles, ought rather to pleaſe than offend you. For what concerns <hi>Zantippe,</hi> ſhe it may be you us'd lets us know, you did not believe 'twas <hi>Socrates</hi>'s wife, and I think you only play'd upon the Names, or tempted the goodneſs of your Memory; for, you know, the Time and other circumſtances deſtroy this fancy. For the Sacrifice of <hi>Ariſtotlé,</hi> if he held the Divinity of <hi>Ceres</hi> as veritable, I would blame him exceedingly for having prophan'd it; but if he was undeceiv'd, ought you to wonder, if to honour what he lov'd, he paid to his Miſtreſs the reſpects which the Vulgar ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd to Idols, and perform'd a Ceremony, which not only was indifferent to him, but which he laugh'd at? You know that he fled from <hi>Athens,</hi> for fear leſt the Magiſtrates, through the politick neceſſity of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſhould uſe him for matters of Religion, as they did <hi>Socrates,</hi> and, as he ſaid, leſt he ſhould be forc'd to ſin againſt Philoſophy. Having examin'd the Actions of theſe two Great men, we will not meddle with the reſt particularly, becauſe you propoſe them but in groſs, and our general Reaſons may ſerve to your general Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation. Now, as if you had foreſeen, that theſe <hi>Greek</hi> Examples were weak and could not decide the affair, you deſcend to our Knights errant, and bring in <hi>Orlando Furioſo;</hi> but if you will have Romances, and conſent we ſhould draw conſequences from them, we have abſolutely gain'd our Cauſe. But you paſs him and come to <hi>Antony, Hannibal, Sampſon, David</hi> and <hi>Solomon;</hi> ſee a troup of Enemies muſter'd againſt me, but a little patience will lay this Storm, and in a few words I ſhall be able to rid my ſelf of theſe famous
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:62940:40"/>Names wherewith M. <hi>Menage</hi> thinks to oppreſs me. Let us begin with <hi>Antony;</hi> this <hi>Roman</hi> having only judg'd of <hi>Cleopatra</hi> by his eyes, and ſuffering himſelf to be ſeduc'd by thoſe Flatterers, which ruin'd him by upbraiding him with the kindneſſes of this Queen, ſtill crying out to him
<q>O homme ingrat de tant de doux baiſers.</q>This <hi>Roman,</hi> I ſay, deſerves to be put amongſt the Lovers we have blam'd. To make Love the Author of <hi>Hannibals</hi> loſſes, is it not to be ignorant that the Feaſts, and Bannia's and Delights of <hi>Capua</hi> ruin'd him? and if Love had any part in it, 'twas that debauch'd Love which we condemn, and which ordinarily follows Wine and Idleneſs. The ſame may be ſaid to the reſt of your Examples. Now after you have ended their retail, you paſs on to a general Maxim, that all Lovers are Fools; which you pretend to prove by their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and by their Diſcourſe; and to this purpoſe you leave the firm Land to go to an Iſland where you aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Lovers. And here your Learning furniſhes you with a long train of paſſages which you cite from the <hi>Greeks, Latins, Spaniards, Italian;</hi> but truly you take all theſe things in the worſt ſenſe, and 'tis not fit we explain them thus literally as you do. They are things, as I ſaid, that Wit has invented, but does not believe, and a peculiar Language, which long Cuſtome hath paſt from hand to hand, amongſt all thoſe who have wrote of Love. Believe me, we ought not to baniſh figures of diſcourſe: let us not imbroil our ſelves with Lovers that make Verſe; let us leave them their Pearls, Scarlet, Roſes, Lillies, the <hi>Aurora</hi> and the Sun, which they have poſſeſt time out of mind. But whatever they ſay, let us not think they take Hair for Chains, nor Eyes for Archers. If we find one of the Ancients com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:62940:41"/>his Torch be put out, for the fire of his Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on makes it light enough, let us not imagine he is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded 'tis ſo: and if we meet with one of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derns ſinging to his Guitarr, that the Paſſing-bell ſhould be toll'd as often as his Miſtreſs arms her ſelf with her two Suns, let us for all that believe, that this <hi>Spaniard</hi> fear'd a Feaver or the Small Pox, more than the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter of this Baſilisk. If I ſhould now combat your Citations with others, and ſeek Loves Praiſes in Books, the day would fail before I could finiſh half of them. As for thoſe Lovers which you make to act worſe than they ſpeak, which Stab, Hang, and Drown themſelves; I can tell you, that 'tis out of faſhion now: But if any of theſe deſperate perſons remain any where, but upon our Theaters, I conſent that ſuch depravers of honeſt Love be chain'd up, not only in your Iſle of <hi>Petrarch,</hi> but in the inacceſſible Iſle of <hi>Polexander,</hi> leſt the mode ſhould return again. But to anſwer what you find more to ſay againſt the Humors and Actions of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers; you do ill to make Crimes of indifferent Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantries, of theſe garlands of Flowers with which they crown'd the Doors, or thoſe little Courtſhips which like Garments fall into the modes of the Age wherein we live, or places where we dwell. I could ſend you again to <hi>Plutarch,</hi> who ſays, That what young Lovers ordinarily do, as to go in Maſquerade, to Dance, to Sing, to preſent Noſegays, brings ſome handſom and honeſt relief to their Paſſion: and in one word, for what concerns theſe little things which you diſallow, Nature hath as great a ſhare in them, as Love, and we muſt not lay to its charge the defects of Humanity. Now there nothing remains but to anſwer the deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion you give of our Youth of both Sexes. In which particular I cannot do better than to proceed with you as <hi>Homers Jupiter,</hi> who of two things <hi>Agamemnon</hi> ask'd, granted him one, and refus'd him one; ſo I will
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:62940:41"/>confeſs, there are ſome of our Young Gentlemen ſuch as you paint them, and who doubtleſs are worthy of your Scorn: but I not only deny that 'tis Love which betrays them to this condition, but on the contrary, I know nothing which can redeem them from it, but an honeſt applying themſelves to ſome Lady of Merit. The beſt is, that the number of them is but ſmall, and your Satyr hits but few. It is true for the Citizen, that the fooliſh Pride which deſcends to them with their Inheritance, and thoſe falſe Idea's which they form of a Voluptuous life, corrupt in them the ſenſe of Vertue. But this diſorder is not general. In the mean time you accuſe Love for this Artificial handſomneſs, which you pretend effeminates our Youth, and alledge that ſuch men ſeem to ſeek other men; to which I reply no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but that it were to be wiſh'd they reſembled him who was firſt reproach'd with it, which you know was <hi>Pompey,</hi> and you know alſo, that if it had not been for one man, <hi>Pompey</hi> had been the firſt man of the World. As for <hi>Paris,</hi> what he did was without doubt of bad Example, but I cannot think you will impute his want of Courage to his Beauty, for then Hector ſhould have been as very a Poltron as he, ſeeing <hi>Homer</hi> calls him
<q>Hector ayant le viſage tres-beau.</q>And <hi>Achilles</hi> ſhould have been the verieſt Coward a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Greeks,</hi> ſeeing, according to the report of the ſame <hi>Homer,</hi> he was the faireſt. Let us add, to reconcile you to mens Beauty, the requeſt that <hi>Thales</hi> made to the young <hi>Eumetis,</hi> that <hi>Thaeles,</hi> which you eſteem wiſer than all his ſix Companions together, finding this Maid accommodating the Hair of <hi>Anachar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis,</hi> whom the <hi>Barbarians</hi> oppos'd alone to all the Sages of <hi>Greece,</hi> he kiſs'd her and pray'd her to dreſs up the <hi>Scythian</hi> in ſuch a manner, that he might appear hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:62940:42"/>to the Company that were to Sup with <hi>Periander.</hi> You ſee then, that Beauty is not a fault in men, and that what Faults they have cannot be imputed to Love. And are you not of this opinion, when in that part of your diſcourſe wherein you imploy our Gallants to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch and pervert the Conſciences of our Ladies, you blame them for not being content with a union of hearts and wills? whereby you ſeem to acknowledge, as well as I, an honeſt Love which may there be termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, and that thoſe who paſs thoſe bounds by Exceſs, corrupt Love, and are not corrupted by it. 'Tis true, anſwer'd M. <hi>Menage,</hi> I did merrily tell you that theſe Gentlemen would not ſtop there, but I did not ſay they ought to do ſo: and to examine the matter better, if you reduce your honeſt Love to theſe Spiritual affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, I fear your defence is but ill grounded. Not but that I know, how Philoſophers in all times have boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of this Union of hearts; but I know alſo, what <hi>Cicero</hi> obſerves, that theſe People wrote magnificently concerning things, which they practis'd no better than the Common people; and the conceit of a <hi>Greek</hi> Poet pleaſes me well, who ſaith, he can no more be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that a Lover does adore without hoping any thing, than that a Beggar does importune a Rich man, without pretending to draw an Alms from him. After all, you know how thoſe <hi>Stoick</hi> Philoſophers were laugh'd at in <hi>Atheneus,</hi> who ſaid, they had no deſign but upon the Soul. Here you will alledge what <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi> writes, that the love of the Body cannot be call'd Love; and that <hi>Euripides</hi> contends for a Love that only purſues the mind, and that in fine, an <hi>Italian</hi> calls the Union of hearts
<q>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ltima ſpeme di corteſi amanti.</q>But after all we muſt return to Nature, which hath an
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:62940:42"/>end more noble and more neceſſary, that is, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation of the Species, and which draws us to it by the charms of Beauty; and conclude, that in deſpite of all theſe refin'd Reaſonings, that theſe Spiritual Lovers dwell only in the imagination of thoſe who feign them. In this particular, ſays M. <hi>Trilport,</hi> I fall in with the Opinion of M. <hi>Menage;</hi> and for my part I believe that it was the opinion of the Ancients, but thoſe who have deſcanted upon their Love Treatiſes, have a little too much ſubtiliz'd their thoughts. For inſtance, What would you have us judge of the Diſcourſe which <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> holds in the Banquet of <hi>Zenophon,</hi> but that he approves the Love where the Body hath its part as well as the Mind? ſeeing 'tis ſaid, that the whole Company were ſo touch'd with this Diſcourſe, that thoſe who were Married haſtned home to make much of their Wives, and all the Young people ſwore to Marry forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. Truly, added I, ſeeing one of the Ancients ſaid, Beauty was the flower of Vertue, I cannot think M. <hi>Ch.</hi> will be ſo unjuſt to forbid honeſt people loving this Flower; on the contrary, I aſſure my ſelf he will judge of Loves as of Orange-trees, which are the fairer for bearing Flower and Fruit together; and that he will alſo believe, that Love muſt be ſo much the more ſatisfactory, by how much the Lady we ſerve is Fair. I will not meddle with you two, replies M. <hi>Ch.</hi> having enough to do to ſave a wholſom Propoſition from the art and force of M. <hi>Menage.</hi> Beſies, I am not at ſuch diſtance from your laſt opinion. And if you mark'd my words, I ſaid, Love might cofine it ſelf to a Union of hearts, not that it ought; and in my opinion it may paſs further, provided it does not lead us into diſorder. That which further keeps me from blaming your Opinion is, that I hold the nature of perfect Love to be ſuch, that it grows in the poſſeſſion of what we love; for a generous mind cannot receive
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:62940:43"/>new favours without augmenting its Paſſion. Thus when I have granted you, that Love tends to enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; I muſt add at the ſame time, that the Good tend to it by good ways of Honour, Vertue and fair qualities, which render a man lovely; and that we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to acquire them when we love after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. On the contrary, thoſe who manage their paſſion ill, and who love without choice, imploy evil means; whence it happens, that their intreagues being ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd and ill conducted, are not laſting, end with Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal, and during their courſe are travers'd with conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual diſorders. Confeſs now, that in this Chapter you find me leſs ſevere than you expected. We find you, ſays M. <hi>Trilport,</hi> in this, as in all the reſt of your Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents, very reaſonable. And I, adds M. <hi>M.</hi> am content to agree with you here; and in the mean time, replies M. <hi>Ch.</hi> this will not favour your Opinion; for though I confeſs to you, that the Body makes up part of the Object which Love propounds to it ſelf, this will not ſay that Love is irregular, as you think, but on the contrary renders it more accompliſh'd, and the poſſeſſion of Beauty is a Cord that binds it more ſtrongly and more ſweetly; but this is when we uſe it well, and that we chooſe before we love. Let us come now to an apology for the Ladies, which you handle after a ſtrange rate. You will tell me, you mean only the Goſſips; if ſo, we are agreed, for your diſcourſe does not touch me; but this Invective was too general, and 'tis not to be thought, that a man who hath attack'd the reputation of <hi>Penelope</hi> and <hi>Lucrece,</hi> aims only at thoſe who make profeſſion of being fair, and lay out for a great many Servants. However, I am willing to believe, that in this you have imitated <hi>Euripides,</hi> who blam'd upon the Theater the Sex he ador'd in private, and that you have not ſpoken ill of them becauſe you believ'd it, or becauſe you have been
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:62940:43"/>wronged by them, and the deſign of well defending your Paradox hath made you betray your Conſcience; for I know no man reſpects or eſteems Ladies more than you, to ſay nothing of your Loves, in which you paſs for the true <hi>paſtor fido.</hi> But this Conſideration ſhall not ſtop me from aſſaulting your diſcourſe; and as you have appear'd to us a great Enemy of Ladies, I find my ſelf obliged to defend them from your accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation; which I will make appear to you is more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious than true. In effect, 'tis eaſie to ſuſtain their Cauſe; if 'twere unjuſt, their Beauty only would ſuffice to plead it. You muſt remember the Judges of <hi>Greece,</hi> and the Courtizan <hi>Phrine;</hi> this Woman was accus'd; <hi>Hyperides</hi> defended her; he was a famous Oratour, and one from whom might be expected all the ſuccours of Eloquence; but the cauſe being very foul, and the Judges ſevere, his Rhetorick was too weak, and the matter inclin'd towards a hard Sentence: Now to what had this Advocate recourſe in this deſperate caſe? to an infallible remedy, to the Beauty of <hi>Phrine;</hi> he tears the Robe of this Criminal, and lets them ſee ſo fair a perſon, that making Conſcience of condemning her, they ſent her away diſcharged of her Accuſation; whence <hi>Horace</hi> learn'd,
<q>
                  <l>Segnius irritant animos demiſſa per aures,</l>
                  <l>Quàm quae ſunt oculis ſubjecia ſidelibus.</l>
               </q>I aſſure my ſelf, if I ſhould do ſo, I ſhould not find you more difficult than theſe Reverend Judges; but as I do not ſpeak of Courtizans or Goſſips, ſo I have no need of uſing violent Remedies, and 'twill be enough for me to perſwade your Reaſon, and not drag it along by force. I ſpeak for Ladies which we call ſolid, whoſe Sentiments are elevate and noble; in a word, for Ladies which are not of your faſhion. But yet,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:62940:44"/>Ladies that can ſuffer Courtſhip; and we believe 'tis not misbecoming them to make illuſtrious Slaves: and we dare not be more ſevere than <hi>Plutarch,</hi> who advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes honeſt Women to ſacrifice to Love. It reſts we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, whether there are many ſuch to be found, or only thoſe which you have mention'd. But this Sex hath not been ſo unhappy as you pretend. All Ages have had illuſtrious Women as well as Men, and they have ſhar'd with us in all good qualities. I will not prove their Vertues to you by Examples, which you may doubt of; I will not tell you, that during the courſe of Seven hundred years there was not one marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Iſle of <hi>Chio,</hi> which was not found a Virgin; I will not cite the <hi>Amazons</hi> which fought againſt <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules:</hi> in the humor you are in you will hold the firſt for Apocryphal, and will ſay, the laſt is not very cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. I only ſay, that in all Nations Women have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd in the general, and in the particular, quantity of remarkable Actions both for Policy and War. Hiſtory hath plac'd a great many Queens at the head of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires and Monarchies: if we would have marks of their Courage, Wit, and Vertue, without ſeeking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Modern <hi>Indians,</hi> or our Ancient <hi>Gauls,</hi> the glorious paleneſs which we ſee in the face of <hi>Seneca</hi>'s Wife, tells us, ſhe will die with her Husband. <hi>Arria,</hi> by giving her ſelf a deadly wound, teaches us better than <hi>Petus</hi> to deſpiſe this life. <hi>Portia</hi> will periſh gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly after <hi>Brutus.</hi> And when we ſee <hi>Sophronia</hi> and <hi>Olindo</hi> inviron'd with flames, we cry out
<q>
                  <l>O ſpectacolo grande oue à tenzone,</l>
                  <l>Sono amore e magnanimo virtute.</l>
               </q>But we ſhall be ſurpriz'd with a profound aſtoniſhment, ſeeing <hi>Laena</hi> dumb-in the midſt of Torments, and as little apt to reveal the Complices in the Conſpiracy of
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:62940:44"/>
               <hi>Harmodius</hi> and <hi>Ariſtogiton</hi> (who, as <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſpeaks, had drank in the ſame Cup of Love with her) as that Lio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Braſs could have been, which the <hi>Athenians</hi> would have erected without a Tongue, in favour of the ſilence of this woman. If we would have quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties more peaceable, <hi>Greece,</hi> which vaunts of Nine <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi> Poets, boaſts alſo of Nine Ladies excellent in this kind of Poetry: and <hi>Pindar,</hi> the Prince of theſe Nine famous Poets, was the Scholar of <hi>Myrtis,</hi> one of thoſe Ladies, and was not aſham'd to be corrected by <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> who was another of them; nor five times to be ſolemnly overcome by her. If we go amongſt the Philoſophers, <hi>Aſpatia</hi> can boaſt ſhe did ſhare with <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibiades</hi> the Cares and the Love of <hi>Socrates,</hi> and we ſhall find <hi>Leontia</hi> in the Gardens of <hi>Epicurus.</hi> But if we deſcend to our Age and our Court, we ſhall find as in a crowd theſe wonders, which were but thinly ſcatter'd in the paſt; and we ſhall confeſs with reaſon, that theſe illuſtrious perſons are the honour of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and have their minds no leſs perfect than their faces. You know the Ladies I ſpeak of as well as I, and what honour I owe to this great Princeſs; you often enter her Palaces, which are fam'd for celebrious Schools, where utmoſt Politeneſs is learnt: and I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal from you to your ſelf, whether there men are judg'd of by their outſides or the advantages of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. Believe me, theſe are the Examples you ought to have produc'd, and not have troubled your ſelf to ſhake the Reputation of <hi>Penelope</hi> and <hi>Lucrece,</hi> too well eſtabliſh'd by the general opinion and conſent of ſo many Ages, to depend upon a Jeſt, a Tradition, or a Manuſcript. That which remains to be prov'd is, that there does redound very great advantages to thoſe who are happy enough to be of the number of our Lovers, and who have their Souls rais'd to that point, that they dare aſpire to pleaſe excellent perſons of the other Sex; but
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:62940:45"/>the heat being over, and it being almoſt time to walk abroad, I muſt end, for I make conſcience of hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring you from a walk in an Evening that prepares it ſelf to be very freſh and fair. M. <hi>Trilport</hi> and my ſelf, and M. <hi>Menage,</hi> who took a ſingular pleaſure in heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to M. <hi>Gh.</hi> and to whom the matter was not ſo material, that he ſhould care much though he chang'd an opinion, which he had taken up only for Diſcourſe fake; when, I ſay, we had all conjur'd him not to make ſuch haſte, I have been too long, replied M. <hi>Chappelein,</hi> and I was not reſolv'd to ſpend any more time in teaching you a Doctrine which you know as well as I; however, ſeeing I am engag'd, I will add a few words. No body replying, he continued in this manner: I have always eſteem'd the Opinion of <hi>Empedocles,</hi> who calls Love the principle of all good; and indeed, when we exactly examine mens lives, it does ſeem to be the ſource and original of whatever paſſes well. For whether we conſider the policies of Towns and buſineſs of Peace, or whether we regard the Wars of Nations, which have been the Theaters of Heroick Vertue, both publick employments and private retreats owe to Love what they have of fair, ſweet, and honeſt. To begin with War; <hi>Plutarch</hi> takes notice of divers Nations, who were ſubject to Love and extreamly Warlike: he reckons up ſeveral Great men addicted to Love. We may ſay, that this divinity preſides no leſs in Combats than in the calms of Peace; at leaſt, the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> Sacrificed to him in the head of their Troops, when they were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to begin a fight. The <hi>Candiots</hi> did the ſame, only with this difference, that they drew out the faireſt men from among their ranks to offer this Sacrifice. There have been Nations who to aſſure themſelves of Victory, would have the perſons lov'd Spectators of the actions of their Lovers in ſight. But to ſay all,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:62940:45"/>Did Antiquity ever ſee any thing more gallant than that Cohort of <hi>Thebaus,</hi> which they call'd Sacred, and which was compos'd of Lovers? And do not you fancy the criticiſm of <hi>Pamenes,</hi> who cenſures the Sage <hi>Neſtor</hi> for having in <hi>Homer</hi> put the <hi>Greeks</hi> in Battel by Nations, whereas he ought to have put all the Lovers by themſelves? I willingly pick out <hi>Greek</hi> Examples, becauſe we muſt confeſs, that this Nation knew and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem'd Love better than any other; but yet I know not any which has not had its brave Lovers, or where Valour does not owe much to Love. To this purpoſe, I remember that amongſt other Romances which were brought me once from <hi>Spain,</hi> one of the Songs began <hi>Muy rebuelto anda Jaen;</hi> this Romance ſpeaks of a ſally the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> made upon the <hi>Moors:</hi> the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> might be twelve or fifteen hundred, all Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of Honour and Lovers in earneſt, theſe are the words of the Song, or rather of the Hiſtory, for theſe Songs ſerv'd then for Chronicles. Now the Poet, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting Religion and Countrey, for which the moſt fearful become valiant, attributes the Victory the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> got only to Love. They ſallied out, ſays he, when they had firſt ſolemnly ſworn upon their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes hands, not to return to <hi>Jaen</hi> without a Captive <hi>Moor,</hi> and thoſe who had Miſtreſſes exceeding fair, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd for four Priſoners. If from theſe general A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions we ſhould paſs to particular ones, we might judge that <hi>Plato</hi> had good reaſon to call Love the General undertaker, and that he believed Love gave Courage, ſeeing the only recompence he appoints for the Conquerours after a fight, is the pleaſure of choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing amongſt the faireſt perſons her he beſt likes, and to kiſs her. In this your <hi>Perceforeſts</hi> hath imitated him, and the prize in one of his famons <hi>Tournaments</hi> is to kiſs the faireſt Woman in <hi>Great Britain.</hi> Now theſe <hi>Tournaments,</hi> which during the time of Peace
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:62940:46"/>were little Images of War, never had other object but the Love of Ladies; and as they paſt into <hi>Europe</hi> with the <hi>Moors,</hi> ſo among the <hi>Moors</hi> 'twas Love invented them: I will end this after I have let you know, that <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and <hi>Iſabel</hi> could not conquer the Kingdom of <hi>Granada</hi> till the King <hi>Chico</hi> had baniſh'd the <hi>Aben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerages,</hi> that is to ſay, Love; the Knights of this Race being the greateſt Courtiers, and the moſt amorous of all the <hi>Africans.</hi> Yea, Fame had rais'd them to ſuch a high eſteem for gallantry, that 'twas ſaid, never any <hi>Abencerage</hi> had ſerv'd Lady of <hi>Granada</hi> without being favour'd by her, and that never Lady was thought worthy of the Name, if ſhe had not an <hi>Abencerage</hi> to be her Servant. Thus much is ſaid by the <hi>Moor Abin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deraſs</hi> in the <hi>Diana</hi> of <hi>Montmajor;</hi> where the Hiſtory of this Lover ſeems to me ſo lively handled, that if it were ſeparate from the body of the Romance, what <hi>Greece</hi> hath beſt in this kind would have no other ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage over this ſmall Adventure, than that of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity. And now having ſeen Love cover'd in the arms of <hi>Mars,</hi> valiant and victorious; let us place him in a condition a little more tranquill, in calms and peace. <hi>Zeno</hi> the <hi>Stoick</hi> teacheth us, that in this eſtate he hath care of things which concern the welfare of the Common-wealth, and that he is the god of Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Friendſhip and Concord: And we read in <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neus,</hi> that he was much honoured in the Alliances of Nations. After this, if we conſider the good manners of a City, the <hi>Athenians,</hi> the moſt poliſh'd men in the World, will ſhew us in the Academy dedicated to <hi>Minerva,</hi> the Statue of Love with that of this god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſs. If we ſeek Opinions more regular than the Common one and will not be ſatisfied but with thoſe of Philoſophers, <hi>Atheneus</hi> will inform us, that in the place where they did their Exerciſes was rais'd the Statues of <hi>Mercury, Hercules</hi> and <hi>Cupid;</hi> to ſhew that
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:62940:46"/>Eloquence and Strength are unprofitable, unleſs Love guides them. If we have a mind to paſs a little amidſt honeſt divertiſments, <hi>Euripides</hi> will tell us, that 'tis Love which hath beſtow'd Verſe and Muſick upon us. And an <hi>Italian</hi> will confirm you in this opinion,
<q>
                  <l>Amor primo truovò le rime e verſi,</l>
                  <l>E ſuoni e canti, e ogni melodia.</l>
               </q>But not to do all by Authority, but after theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing Teſtimonies to give ſome place to Reaſon, I ask of you if it be not true, that Man being an animal born to live in Society, amidſt this great diverſity of humors which we behold the moſt accommodating are the beſt? You will grant me this without doubt; but this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency is nothing elſe but a deſign to pleaſe, and that we have not this deſign without ſome object, I do not ſuſpect you will deny me. In the mean time, uſually Young people do not take up this deſign to pleaſe, but in order to render themſelves agreeable to Women, that they may return them their Love; for, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ambition nor Avarice can carry them to this, I believe you will alſo confeſs. Then at the ſame time grant me, that by this Love is bred in mens minds the quality which is moſt neceſſary to Civil life, which is, to know perfectly, and without trouble to accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date ones ſelf to the Manners and Sentiments of others. And without doubt, this ſweetneſs of Spirit is ſo much an effect of Love, that the <hi>Thebans</hi> did not ordain that Love ſhould be practis'd publickly amongſt them, but with deſign to adulce and bend their Manners, which were too groſs and rude. But Love not only renders us capable of acting civilly, and of being eſteem'd, it not only gives us good qualities, but corrects our bad; and <hi>Plutarch</hi> compares it divinely to the Dictator, whoſe power ſuſpended the functions of all the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:62940:47"/>of the <hi>Roman</hi> Common-wealth, whereby he would ſignifie, that all our other Paſſions do not appear when this poſſeſſes us. The <hi>Polyphemus</hi> of the Poets, not only forgot his barbariſm and cruelty when he fell in Love, but, as one of the Ancient ſays, he went ſo far as to turn gallant, and comforted himſelf in his love with ſinging. <hi>Pluto</hi> himſelf, this inexorable God
<q>
                  <l>Et ces barbares coeurs que jamais l'amitiè,</l>
                  <l>Ni les pleurs des humains n'eſmeurment à pitiè.</l>
               </q>gave up <hi>Euridice</hi> to the love of <hi>Orpheus; Circes</hi> left her Wichcraſts for <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes,</hi> with whom ſhe treated ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely and faithfully. Did not Love make an able man of an Ideot in <hi>Baccace,</hi> who repreſents his <hi>Cimon</hi> in his nature ſo much a Block, that to increaſe the number of them he voluntarily left the City to dwell in Woods; And becauſe likeneſs breeds love, he reſolv'd to ſeek no Friendſhip but that of Animals; and as a good Politian he imitated them ſo well, that he forgot hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Speech, retaining only a confuſed and indiſtinct ſound, which ſignified nothing but the beſtiality of <hi>Cimon.</hi> One day, whether by chance or deſtiny, he found a beauteous young Lady ſleeping under the Trees; he thought he ſaw the Sun lying in the ſhade; ſhe wrought in him a Miracle contrary to that of <hi>Meduſa</hi>'s Head, and of a Stone he became a man. He began to uſe that Reaſon which at firſt he did not know, and to himſelf diſcours'd excellently well of Beauty: it ſeem'd that <hi>Cupid</hi> by the wound in his heart let in vertue into his Soul; he beheld that face as an excellent book, and in an inſtant became a Maſter in Loves School; the brightneſs of thoſe eyes though ſhut, did ſhoot light into his eclipſed underſtanding, and in a ſhort time he prov'd an excellent Philoſopher, and a gallant Courtier. Does not this bring us to the <hi>Italian</hi> Proverb?</p>
            <q>Amor puo far gentil un cuor villano.</q>
            <pb n="91" facs="tcp:62940:47"/>
            <p>If theſe Allegorical inſtructions are not enough, Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory will teach us, that the Courtizan <hi>Lais</hi> became ſtaid and conſtant when ſhe fell in love with <hi>Hippolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus.</hi> We ſay further, that Love can make Prodigies in Arts and Sciences; and we may call to mind, that at <hi>Antwerp</hi> they admire to this day the famous Picture of <hi>Quintin,</hi> whom this god in one year, of a Smith which he was before, made the beſt Painter of his Age. If the nobleſt Sentiments are inſpir'd by Love; if 'tis he that corrects our defects; if whatever is handſom in Civil life and in Military actions proceeds from this noble Paſſion, ought we not with <hi>Euripides,</hi> pray the gods to preſerve us from having to do with thoſe who are not initiated into theſe Holy Myſteries, who this Poet calls fierce and ruſtick Spirits; and have we not good reaſon to adviſe Young people not to ſhun Love, but to uſe it well? and this I think is enough to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh what the <hi>Italian</hi> lays down as an aſſured Maxim,
<q>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Conſpiracy of <hi>Walſtein</hi> was certainly one of the moſt famous Enterprizes of the laſt Age; and therefore ſuch as are pleas'd with the recital of great Actions, and who would profit themſelves of the Vices or Vertues of Famous men, will like the Hiſtory. 'Tis this perhaps hath engag'd many Learned men to give us divers relations, which I ſhould eſteem perfect, if they were not intereſſed. But certainly the Animoſities of contrary ſides in which moſt Authors are found, ſlides inſenſibly into their Writings, and Invectives or Flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries fill up the room of Truth. Some have accus'd the Emperour of Cruelty; many prais'd his Prudence and Juſtice. Theſe have render'd <hi>Walſtein</hi> a Monſter; thoſe, a Hero: whilſt love to the Court of <hi>Vienna,</hi> hatred to the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria;</hi> a deſign to pleaſe or to offend, hath depriv'd them of the freedom of ſpeaking.</p>
            <pb n="94" facs="tcp:62940:49"/>
            <p>I, not being preoccupied with any of theſe Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, and finding my ſelf at equal diſtance from hope and fear, eſteem it no offence againſt modeſty, if, after ſo many Famous men, I alſo write a Relation of this Conſpiracy. But we muſt firſt ſpeak of the manners and power of this Man.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Albert Walſtein</hi> was of a great and bold Spirit, but unquiet and enemy of Repoſe; tall and ſtrong of Body; his Face rather majeſtick than pleaſant; he was natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally very Temperate, ſleeping little, alwaies in action; ſupporting eaſily Cold and Hunger; flying Pleaſures, and ſurmounting the incommodities of the Gout and Age, by temperance and exerciſe; ſpeaking little, thinking much; writing all his Affairs himſelf; vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant and judicious in War; dextrous in raiſing and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaining Armies; ſevere in puniſhing, prodigal in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenſing, but with choice and deſign; always firm againſt evil Fortune; civil in occaſion, otherwiſe proud and fierce; immeaſurably ambitious; envious of others Fame, jealous of his own; implacable in his hatred, cruel in his revenge; apt to kindle; a friend of Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence, Oſtentation, and Novelty; extravagant in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, but doing nothing without deſign; never wanting the Publick good for pretext, though he made all ſerve to the growth of his Fortune; deſpiſing Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, which he kept in ſervice of his Policy. Extreamly artificial, chiefly in appearing diſintereſs'd, curious and clear-ſighted in the deſigns of others, moſt adviſed in the conduct of his own; above all, dextrous in hiding them; and was by ſo much the more impenetrable, as he affected in publick candour and liberty, blaming in others that diſſimulation whereof he ſerv'd himſelf on all occaſions. This Man, having ſtudied carefully the Maxims and Conduct of ſuch, who from a private con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition had arriv'd at Sovereignty, was always fill'd with thoughts and elevated hopes, deſpiſing ſuch as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:62940:49"/>themſelves with a Mediocrity. In what eſtate ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Fortune placed him, he dreamt always of mending it: and at laſt being come to that point of Greatneſs, that there was nothing but Crowns above him, he had the courage to think of uſurping that of <hi>Behemia.</hi> And though he knew the deſign full of peril and perfidiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, he deſpis'd the danger which he had always ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted, and thought all actions honeſt which tended to Empire. 'Tis true, that Ambition, conjuncture of Affairs, and the accidents of his Fortune, repreſenting the Enterprize juſt and facile, puſh'd him upon the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.</p>
            <p>But it is neceſſary, before we begin the Recital, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon his Life to the time of his Revolt, that we may be the better inform'd, what it was that intic'd him to this Conſpiracy, and the means that he u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
            <p>They who have ſaid Fortune rais'd <hi>Walſtein</hi> from the Plough, and that his Birth was obſcure, err'd through Malice or Ignorance: for his Father was a Baron of <hi>Bohemia;</hi> that is, one of the greateſt Lords of that Kingdom, in which there are neither Dukes nor Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſes. The Barons being ſo jealous of their Dignity, that if a ſtranger Duke would be naturaliz'd <hi>Bohemian,</hi> they would oblige him to quit his Title, and to content himſelf with theirs. Beſides, they meaſuring the greatneſs of Families by their Antiquity, ſome Authors have reckon'd that of <hi>Walſtein</hi> among the chief, though not the richeſt. His Father brought him up in the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion, and would have had him apply himſelf to Letters; but his turbulent Spirit not being proper for the repoſe of the Muſes, his Maſters drove him from their Schools, where, inſtead of ſtudying, he made leagues and parties, and took off his Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from their obedience and diſcipline. Such force hath Nature in that age, when it can neither be hid
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:62940:50"/>by diſſimulation, nor corrected by prudence. By this his Parents ſaw themſelves conſtrain'd to ſend him to Court ſooner than they intended; ſo they preſent him Page to the Marqueſs of <hi>Burgh,</hi> Son to the Arch-Duke <hi>Ferdinand</hi> of <hi>Inſpurch.</hi> Whilſt he remained there, fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling from a high Window without hurting himſelf, he turn'd <hi>Catholick:</hi> and fancying, that after this happy ſcape he was reſerv'd for ſomething extraordinary, he quits his Maſter with intent to Travel; thereby to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der himſelf worthy of that, which his deſtiny ſeem'd to promiſe him. He ſees <hi>Germany, England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> accommodating himſelf to the manners and habits of thoſe Countries; noting their Scituations, Laws and Forces, taking from each what he liked beſt, and at laſt ſits down at <hi>Padua,</hi> having curiouſly viſited the reſt of <hi>Italy.</hi> Here it was that he repented his neglect of Learning (abſolutely neceſſary to a Great man) and render'd himſelf capable of Arts, if not knowing in them. Particularly he falls upon the ſtudy of Politicks and Aſtrology, which ſuited his genius and his deſigns: pleaſing himſelf infinitely with thoſe Maxims which are diſtaſted in publick by thoſe who practice them in private; fancying for himſelf immoderate Grandeurs, lodg'd in the Stars, which he did not forbear to hope for, though his Reaſon ſeem'd to ſet them at an infinite diſtance. But partly awaking from this dream, his mind ſtuff'd with vaſt pretentions, perceiving that with his ſmall Forces 'twas not poſſible for him to compaſs his deſigns, reſolves to accommodate his means to his ends by ſeeking in Marriage a rich and noble Lady; and gain'd, by his excellent addreſs, ſo much on her affections, that ſhe preferr'd him to ſeveral Great perſons, who were ingaged before him. And after ſhe was married, continued ſo deſperately amorous and jealous, that ſhe had almoſt kill'd him by mixing with his drink one of thoſe <hi>Philters,</hi> which inſtead of win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:62940:50"/>the mind wounds it; making ſtrange havock in the body that ſuffers its violences. A Poyſon by ſo much the more inevitable, as it ſtands for a mark of affection with thoſe that give it. He was ſcarce recovered when his Wife dies without Children, leaving him her Heir and Maſter of a great Eſtate. Soon after, the War of the Arch-Duke <hi>Ferdinand</hi> with the <hi>Venetians</hi> breaking out in <hi>Friol,</hi> he imbrac'd the occaſion he had ſo often wiſh'd, and thought ſo neceſſary for him: believing, that to able men, the way of Arms was the moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and ſhorteſt to arrive at Greatneſs; whereas Peace might enrich many, but rais'd few: ſo levying at his own charge three hundred Horſe well appointed, he offer'd his own and their Service to the Duke at the Siege of <hi>Gradisk:</hi> where, by his liberality to his Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and readineſs to ſuccour his Souldiers in their neceſſities; by his conduct in War; often fortunate, alwaies remarkable, doing actions extraordinary; praiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing other mens, ſilent in his own; acting with vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance and care; keeping his Troops in abundance, when the whole Army wanted; he put himſelf in the repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of one, that amongſt many good qualities had ſome extraordinary, and gain'd, together with the friendſhip of <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> the charge of Colonel over the <hi>Moravia</hi> Forces.</p>
            <p>The Troubles of <hi>Bohemia</hi> following, and the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of that Kingdom conſpiring againſt the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, <hi>Walſtein</hi> continued faithful, though the Rebels ſolicited him by offers of chief employment, and by the hopes and recompences of the War. But he pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no leſs from the Emperour, and as yet preferring things certain and honeſt to things doubtful and tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuary, after having endeavour'd in vain to repreſs the Sedition of <hi>Prague,</hi> when he ſaw that he could not keep his <hi>Moldavian</hi> Troops in their obedience, and that his Countreymen had confiſcated his Eſtate, he got as much
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:62940:51"/>of the Publick Treaſure as he could, and retir'd to <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enna,</hi> where all was ſqueez'd from him except twelve Thouſand Crowns, which he had conveyed away, and with which he rais'd a Thouſand light Horſe. But here I muſt not omit one paſſage, which ſhew'd the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular care that Fortune took of this man; which is, that at the firſt of theſe Troubles, and before the Rebels had begun the War, the chief of the party enter'd in Arms, and without leave into the privy Chamber of the Emperour; where they made their propoſitions with ſuch inſolence, that one of them, his hand on his Sword, durſt ſay, 'twas that ſhould ſatisfie their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, if denied. In this fear and ſurprize of <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand Walſtein</hi> arriv'd by chance with a new rais'd Troop, which he meant to ſhew the Emperour, which oblig'd theſe bold Rebels, who thought themſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray'd and loſt, to throw down their Arms and to caſt themſelves at the Princes foot, whoſe favour <hi>Walſtein</hi> poſſeſs'd from this time to that of his revolt. Whilſt what he did in this War, particularly his defeating ſix Thouſand <hi>Hungarians</hi> with fifteen Troops of Horſe, purchas'd him an extream Fame and an extream Envy, (for never any could ſeparate theſe two) the Prince of <hi>Leiſtaine</hi> conſtituted Judge of the <hi>Bohemian</hi> Rebels and Governour of the Kingdom, accuſed him at <hi>Vienna.</hi> But he, that well knew the nature of the Court, where Abſence is criminal, if it be not defended, and where Safety is alwaies found, if we will buy it, haſtned thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with ſixty Thouſand Crowns, and not only pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chas'd an eſteem for his Innocence, but minding to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire ſome of the Great ones, that might protect and ſuſtain his Fortunes; beſides that Artifice and Intereſt gain'd him divers, he marries the Daughter of <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Arach,</hi> chief Counſellor and Favourite to <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and by the credit of his Father in Law, and the ſuccours of Money, which he lent the Emperour in his preſſing
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:62940:51"/>neceſſities, he obtain'd, beſides his light Horſe, two Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Foot, and the charge of Serjeant Major General.</p>
            <p>The victories of this party and the weakneſs of the Revolted having in appearance ended the War, <hi>Walſtein,</hi> who perceived how things went, and knew that the Rebellion was rather diſſembled than extinct, and that the Leagues made all over <hi>Europe</hi> againſt the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> might ſurprize it unprovided; undertook a thing as memorable as extraordinary, and whereof the execution might ſeem impoſſible for any Private man, who had not that credit with the Souldier which his good conduct had gain'd him. He offer'd the Emperour to raiſe an Army of thirty Thouſand men at his own charge, on condition he might be General: and ſo wrought by his Induſtry, his Friends, and by ingaging his whole Eſtate, that he in a ſhort time accompliſh'd it, and ſucceeding to the charge of the Marqueſs of <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negro,</hi> who was depos'd for having unfortunately ſerv'd the Emperour in <hi>Tranſylvania,</hi> he ow'd his Dignity to nothing but his Ambition and his Vertue. In this high employment he added much to his Reputation. He took the Town and Dioceſs of <hi>Alberſtad.</hi> Conquer'd <hi>Hall</hi> and its Biſhoprick; waſted the Territories of <hi>Magdeburgh;</hi> enter'd into thoſe of <hi>Anhalt;</hi> fortified <hi>Deſſau;</hi> defy'd <hi>Mansfield,</hi> and with him four Thouſand <hi>Flemings,</hi> the chief Force of the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Army. After that, having taken <hi>Debſt,</hi> and perceiving that <hi>Mansfield</hi> and <hi>Weimar</hi> with their Forces bent towards <hi>Hungary</hi> by way of <hi>Sileſia,</hi> to give life to the Rebellion and joyn with <hi>Bethlem Gabor,</hi> he purſu'd <hi>Bethlem</hi> and <hi>Mansfield,</hi> and finding them at the Siege of <hi>Novegrade,</hi> vanquiſh'd them; cut in pieces the <hi>Janizaries</hi> that were come to the ſuccour of <hi>Tranſylvania,</hi> and drove <hi>Mansfield</hi> out of <hi>Germany,</hi> who had been its Terrour for ſo many years. Return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into <hi>Sileſia,</hi> where he found <hi>Weimar</hi> dead, he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd half his Troops to ſurrender themſelves, and
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:62940:52"/>overcame the reſt, took in all the revolted Towns, and after he had pacified the hereditary Provinces, led his victorious Army, ſtrengthen'd by that of <hi>Tilly,</hi> againſt the King of <hi>Denmark.</hi> With theſe great Forces he defies the Marquis of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rlach,</hi> conquers the Archbiſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prick of <hi>Breme</hi> and <hi>Holſace,</hi> fill'd his Troops out of the new Levies that <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Lauemburgh</hi> had rais'd for the Enemy; render'd himſelf Maſter of all that lies between the Ocean and the <hi>Baltick</hi> Sea; leaving the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> nothing but <hi>Glucſtad,</hi> and that little corner of Land which is ſeparated from the reſt of his Dominions. And though the King had tempted his Fortunes, he was ſtill worſted; <hi>Walſtein</hi> driving him out of <hi>Pomerania,</hi> into which Province he had made a deſcent and progreſs; forcing him to remount his Ships, where yet perhaps he had not found his ſafety, if <hi>Walſtein</hi> had had Sea Forces: inſomuch as from that time to the Peace of <hi>Lubeck,</hi> the <hi>Dane</hi> never enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd any thing, contenting himſelf to ſuccour thoſe of the <hi>Sound,</hi> who only were able to ſtop the torrent of the Imperial Arms, which ſo many Nations had in vain oppoſed.</p>
            <p>In this flouriſhing eſtate of the Empire, <hi>Walſtein</hi> wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling that his Maſter ſhould profit himſelf of his victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and build the greatneſs of his Houſe upon the weakneſs of his Enemies, leaves <hi>Tilly</hi> in <hi>Friſe,</hi> under pretext that ſomething of the Rebellion remain'd, and that there he ſhould take up his Winter quarters: but in effect it was, that the Emperour might not have any longer the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> for Companion, and that himſelf might remain, without Competitor, ſole Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor of all things. After this, knowing well that the poverty of the Common people and the depreſſion of the Great ones, were the ways that lead to the ſervitude of Nations, free and little affected to the Emperour; inſtead of disbanding this multitude of Souldiers, who,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:62940:52"/>having conquer'd all, ſeem'd now uſeleſs, he rais'd ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral new Troops, and augmented the number of his Officers, to increaſe by their charge the poverty of thoſe who were to defray it. His own Example taught his Commanders ſumptuouſneſs and profuſion; and, to furniſh that, Rapine and Violence. All <hi>Germany</hi> was overflown with theſe Troops: they could no longer diſtinguiſh Friend and Allies, from Enemies and Neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. The Inſolence of the Souldier being unpuniſh'd was boundleſs; as was the Oppreſſion of the people and their hatred againſt <hi>Walſtein,</hi> who they believed the Author of theſe Evils. Beſides, from the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Court was iſſued a ſevere Edict, declaring all thoſe Traytors that were found to have any way participated in the Counſels of the Rebels: by which they had the means to ſecure themſelves of the Great ones, and got money to ſatisfie the Souldiers and Courtiers. It being not only eaſie, but honeſt in appearance, to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniate thoſe they meant to ruine. And that the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> who ſo many miſerable wretches look'd upon as the laſt refuge of their Liberty, ſhould not when he would, or foment a Rebellion, which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him could have no force, or oppoſe himſelf to that abſolute dominion of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> which <hi>Walſtein</hi> labour'd to eſtabliſh; after having condemn'd the Duke of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kelburgh</hi> for holding Intelligence with the Enemy; and being by the gift of <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> Maſter of his Eſtate and Titles; <hi>Walſtein</hi> ſecures himſelf of all the Ports in the <hi>Baltick</hi> Sea, except the <hi>Sound,</hi> to which he laies violent Siege, and put all his care to the equipping of a Fleet, that might render him Maſter of theſe Seas, as he was of <hi>Germany.</hi> And now, in ſpight of hatred or envy, he might quietly have enjoy'd the glory of his great and faithful Services, if his Pride, that was always above his Fortune, had not tranſported him. But being born away with a blind preſumption of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:62940:53"/>and an inſupportable deſpiſing of others; made Prince of the Empire and Duke of <hi>Meckleburgh;</hi> ſtyl'd <hi>Highneſs;</hi> eating alone; ſtamping Money; and in his Equipage, Expences, and ſolicited Audiences affecting to reſemble Kings, he corrupted the ſolidity of his Vertue, and gave the World averſions for his injurious and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Vanities.</p>
            <p>The Peace with the <hi>Danes</hi> being concluded at <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beck,</hi> the Emperour, extraordinarily preſs'd by the Clergy, on whom he depended in all things, precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates himſelf after their paſſions, and reſolves to give the laſt blow to the liberty of <hi>Germany</hi> before it was weak enough to receive it. He publiſhes an Edict, commanding the reſtitution of all the Eccleſiaſtical goods, which the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> had uſurp'd from the firſt Troubles of <hi>Lutheraniſm;</hi> believing, there could not happen to him any ſiniſter accident: Not from abroad, whilſt the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> and <hi>Bohemia</hi> were in War; he of <hi>Denmark</hi> weary of his Loſſes, and the <hi>Tranſylva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> divided into Factions; the <hi>French</hi> buſied among themſelves and in <hi>Italy.</hi> And at home he had <hi>Walſtein;</hi> ever terrible to the Factious, and Armies ready to ſtifle any Sedition before its growth. But the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoil'd of Lands which they had inherited; and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive, that in ſequence of that, their liberty of Conſcience might be taken from them too: finding themſelves in deſpair on theſe conſiderations of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and Intereſt; and the Princes of that party per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving well, that 'twas they were aim'd at; amongſt others, the Elector of <hi>Saxony</hi> ſeeing the command of <hi>Magdeburgh</hi> taken from his Son, which the Town had beſtowed upon him; the Pope having nominated for their Archbiſhop <hi>Leopold</hi> the Son of <hi>Ferdinand;</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd to find remedies for theſe utmoſt extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and, by the help of the <hi>French,</hi> to oblige <hi>Guſtavus Adolphus</hi> King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> alarm'd by what was done
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:62940:53"/>on the <hi>Baltick</hi>-Sea and ambition of Honour, to come to their aſſiſtance under other pretences. On the other ſide, the <hi>Catholick</hi> Princes, to whom the Greatneſs of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> render'd it terrible; and general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all people oppreſt with that Poverty to which they were reduc'd y Contributions and Winter quarters (the invention of <hi>Walſtein,</hi> and not any thing of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick calamity) demanded of the Emperour a General Aſſembly for the good and quiet of his Empire. Chiefly the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> ſolicited this Diet; toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Elector of <hi>Majence,</hi> who he had put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his opinion. The <hi>Bavarois</hi> mortally hated <hi>Walſtein:</hi> whether it was, that he thought him an enemy to the Peace of <hi>Germany;</hi> or whether he had ambition to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend himſelf to the <hi>Electorate,</hi> which 'twas ſaid the Emperour had promis'd him, and <hi>Walſtein</hi> oppos'd. He ſaw alſo that his General <hi>Tilly</hi> was remov'd, and found that abſolute power leſſen'd, which he had me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited by his fidelity in the greateſt peril of the Empire, and by his Services in ſuſtaining the declining Fortunes of <hi>Ferdinand:</hi> and, that which touch'd him neareſt was, that the fruit of all his Labours remain'd in the hands of <hi>Walſtein;</hi> apprehending, that this prodigious Power, to the eſtabliſhing whereof he had contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted with the hazard of his life and Fortunes, might be the ruine of both, if his Enemy, who never par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd any, continu'd any longer the Arbiter. Theſe Conſiderations having caſt him into fear and anger, which ordinarily increaſe proportionably as their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects are juſt; he was the man that moſt earneſtly ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited the Aſſembly, and the depoſing of <hi>Walſtein.</hi> Puſh'd on alſo by Monſieur <hi>de Lem</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadour, and the <hi>Capuchin Joſeph,</hi> a man of Intrigues. It was he alſo, that to obtain this Diet, and to hinder the Emperour from diſcovering, they meant to dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh that Authority which he had uſurped, gave him
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:62940:54"/>hopes, that his Son ſhould be elected King of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans;</hi> an inſenſible introduction to ſucceſſion in the Empire. His Arts took place in a mind that wiſh'd nothing more; for we believe eaſily what we deſire earneſtly. The Emperour with his Son came to <hi>Ratiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone</hi> the end of <hi>June</hi> 1630, where all the Electors were met, except thoſe of <hi>Saxony</hi> and <hi>Brandenburgh;</hi> who excus'd themſelves by their Deputies, as not able to defray the charges of the Journey, the great expence of <hi>Walſteins</hi> Garriſons having impoveriſh'd them: and 'twas true, that fourteen compleat Regiments had Winter'd in the Territories of <hi>Brandenburgh</hi> only. The preſent neceſſity, and the fear of the future, augmented the boldneſs of the <hi>Electors.</hi> And, beſides their depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> who had begun the War in <hi>Germany,</hi> they were imbolden'd by the abſence of Forty thouſand men, who, contrary to the advice of <hi>Walſtein,</hi> were employed in the War of <hi>Mantoua,</hi> or loſt in that of <hi>Polonia.</hi> They were further encourag'd by the <hi>French</hi> Embaſſadour: for upon complaint made in the Diet by the Duke of <hi>Lorain,</hi> that a powerful <hi>French</hi> Army was upon the Frontier, the Embaſſadour aſſur'd the <hi>Electors,</hi> they were there only to ſuſtain their Propoſitions in caſe they ſhould be refuſed. They firſt treated the Peace with the King of <hi>France;</hi> it being of the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> intereſt not to be ingaged with him, that he might the more freely aſſiſt them. Next, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd upon an Aſſembly at <hi>Frankfort</hi> the year following, touching the Edict of the reſtitution, ſeveral difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties impeding the determination now: the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> expecting, that before that time the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> ſhould render it null; and the <hi>Catholicks</hi> believing, that their right would be fortified by the poſſeſſion which they had. But when they came to ſpeak of the affairs of the War, all theſe parties with one common Voice demanded the depoſing of <hi>Walſtein,</hi> and it ſeemed as
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:62940:54"/>if they had aſſembled for nothing elſe. The hatred born him was general; and the weakneſs of the Emperour, aſtoniſh'd by this unthought of blow, was enough to draw a conſent to lay him aſide, and ſo to ſtrip himſelf of his Power and his Fortunes, and to abandon a man whoſe ruines had never been ſo much their ſtudy, if he had been leſs faithful to him, or had render'd him leſs powerful. The <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who often were the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biters of his Councils, deſiring one leſs proud, and more obedient in his place, ſeeing that the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> was deſcended into <hi>Pomerania,</hi> were content with <hi>Tilly,</hi> who the Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> willing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſume his Authority, offer'd them to oppoſe him. The Emperour ſaw himſelf conſtrain'd to disband his Troops of the upper <hi>Germany,</hi> and to conſent to a reformation of the reſt, which loſt him the greateſt part: the Souldier accuſtom'd to pillage, could not or render that which they had taken, or reſolve to take no more. Nor did the Diſorders ſtop here: the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals <hi>Anheim</hi> and <hi>Hoftchen</hi> ſought entertainment elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, and a great number of Officers left his Service. So that from that abſolute eſtate, which made <hi>Germany</hi> tremble under <hi>Walſtein,</hi> the Emperour by his weakneſs, the artifice of the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and the paſſions of his own, was reduc'd in an inſtant to dread the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Forces, which <hi>Walſtein</hi> would have ſlighted, if in his Authority he had retain'd the chief ſtrength of the Empire. His Miniſters perceived as well as he, but too late, that they were deceived; ſeeing, that after he had forſaken all the intereſts of the Empire, on the hopes of making his Son King of the <hi>Romans,</hi> the <hi>Electours</hi> wav'd his nomination by proroguing it; which in ſuch matters, holds the place of a civil Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal.</p>
            <pb n="106" facs="tcp:62940:55"/>
            <p>In the mean time <hi>Walſtein</hi> having heard of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing depos'd, though the ſuddeneſs of the blow ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized him, ſeem'd rather to regret the Misfortune of <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> than his own: Without ſpeaking of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he only ſaid, that the Emperour was betray'd, and his Council corrupted. That ſame Vertue which had gain'd him the Generals Staff, ſerv'd him to reſign it in appearance without diſorder or grief. His diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure for all that was very great, but very ſecret, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known of his Confidents. Divers Colonels repair'd to him: ſome he kept with him; aſſign'd others upon his Lands (whither he ſent them) to live honourably; being in this careful of his Friendſhip and Reputation. Reſolving to keep ſuch men as he gueſs'd by this vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary proof could never abandon him, whatever the dangers were which he might be caſt into by his am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition and reſentments. For certainly, under this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found ſimulation of a moderate Spirit, which he affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in his Misfortunes, he hid an extream deſire of Revenge, and caſt projects to put himſelf into ſuch a condition, that they ſhould not again take away his employment, if the neceſſity of affairs would that they recall'd him to it; whereof <hi>John Baptiſta Seni</hi> his Aſtrologer ſhews him approaching hopes, and whereof he aſſur'd himſelf by the Judgment he made upon the diſorder of the Empire: confirming thus by his own ſolid reaſoning, the conjectures of an uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Art. And thus he fills his mind with high and bold deſigns, even then, when he ſeems to think of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a private life.</p>
            <p>And now it may be ſeaſonable to ſay ſomewhat of his Cuſtomes, and of his Domeſtick life; that you may ſee better how all his actions tended to raiſe him above other men, and with more certainty judge of what we write; to which theſe Remarks ſeem not altogether impertinent: but truly I fear, that in reading them
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:62940:55"/>there will want belief for the Hiſtory, and that the Truths I ſhall deliver, will paſs for the deſcriptions of a Romance. This notwithſtanding ſhall not forbid me to ſpeak of them, without exaggeration, without envy. To begin with his Houſes: That he liv'd in ſeem'd rather the Palace of a Monarch, than the dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of a particular man: for he ſhar'd in this weakneſs with other men, who leave piles of Stone for the Monuments of their Greatneſs; not dreaming of thoſe importunate accidents of Nature or Fortune, which may deſtroy them in a moment; and at the beſt, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever care is taken to preſerve them, they ruine of themſelves. His Houſe at <hi>Prague</hi> received thoſe that came by ſix great Gates; and in a mighty ſpace of ground, caſt its foundation over the ruines of an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Houſes, that were pull'd down to make way for it. The apartments were beautiful, magnificent and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious; the ornaments and movables repreſented Luxury and Abundance, and his Lodgings ſhew'd them in Exceſs. I would willingly deſcribe the retail: the Gardens, beautified with a great number of Statues; the Fountains, Grots, Fiſh-ponds, Volaries; rare for their extent, planted with Trees, fill'd with Birds of all ſorts; if the Hiſtory would ſuffer unprofitable, though pleaſing digreſſions. The Model of this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace was different from all others: whether it was, that he believed his faſhion of Building the beſt; or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by this particular affection, he would alſo in theſe things ſtand at diſtance from vulgar Cuſtomes. Near his Houſe at <hi>Gidzin</hi> he built a Wall about a fair Park, where he kept above three hundred choice Horſes. For his Stables, of choice Architecture; Marble Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and Fountains to fall into them: I forbear to make any particular remark on them, for almoſt all the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Princes are curious in theſe. If Death had not conſtrain'd him to leave his Caſtle of <hi>Segan</hi> unfiniſh'd,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:62940:56"/>poſſibly he had ſurpaſs'd in that Edifice all thoſe of the Ancient <hi>Romans,</hi> as he equall'd them by inlarging the Town of <hi>Gidzin,</hi> building a Charter-houſe, founding a Colledge of <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> and a Church of the <hi>Proteſtants.</hi> Admirable in this particular, that all this was done in thoſe few years that he was Maſter of his Fortune; whereas often, the lives of two Kings do not ſuffice to finiſh a Palace. For his Expence, 'twas an unheard of profuſion. A hundred Diſhes always ſerv'd up to his Table: and the neatneſs added much to the good Chear. Fifty Halbardeers were the conſtant guard of his Anti-Chamber; Men choſen by their Faces, and known by their Actions. Without were Centinels, and every where Lacquies. Twelve men march'd continually about his Palace to hinder Noiſe, which he could not ſuffer: in this, delicate even to weakneſs. He entertain'd ſixty Pages, Sons of the beſt Houſes; who learnt their Exerciſes under famous Maſters, which he kept on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. His Liveries were gorgeous and rich. He had an infinite number of Gentlemen attending him: four of his Chamber inform'd him of thoſe would ſpeak with him, and brought them to audience. Six Barons and ſix Knights were always near him to receive his Commands. The Steward of his Houſe was a Lord of great Note. When he took the field, he had for his Baggage and for his Table fifty Wagons drawn with ſix Horſes, and fifty drawn with four, and ſix Coaches for Gentlemen of Condition, that follow'd his Court. He always carried with him fifty Leer Horſe, beautiful to wonder, and cover'd with the moſt precious Harneſs, and theſe led by fifty men, each mounted on a Horſe of price. Such as love frugal and modeſt Vertue will blame this Pomp, whilſt ſuch as adore outward Vanity will like it, and all will judge it eaſie for <hi>Walſtein,</hi> living more ſplendidly than Kings, to aim at their rank and dignity. I have not mention'd the Palace of his
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:62940:56"/>Wife; the Penſions he gave, or the Recompences: nor of the vaſt ſums he ſpent throughout <hi>Europe</hi> to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd of all; I have ſaid enough, methinks, for my deſign and for my leaſure: Beſides, that things of this nature pleaſe in paſſing, but tire us when we dwell upon them. Let us then betake our ſelves to the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
            <p>After <hi>Walſtein</hi> had given up his Command, thoſe who in his ſtead they oppoſed to the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> having little experience in Military Affairs; ſome want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Courage, others Foreſight; all, good Fortune; their Party was weakned by ſeveral loſſes. The E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectors of <hi>Saxony</hi> and <hi>Brandenburgh</hi> left it openly, joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with <hi>Guſtavus;</hi> and 'twas only <hi>Tilly,</hi> that ſuſtain'd for a time the burthen of the War. He, who poſſeſt the Vertues of a good Captain, Fortune, Prudence, Valour, Care; and, what is rare, Piety, endeavour'd to arreſt the Victories of the Enemy, and to maintain the Reputation of his own. But whether it were, that he alone was not ſufficient for the conduct of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours Armies, and thoſe of the <hi>Catholick</hi> Princes, Leagu'd for the defence of <hi>Germany;</hi> or whether he was deſtitute of the abſolute Authority of <hi>Walſtein;</hi> ſo that not daring to undertake any thing, without conſulting the Council of <hi>Vienna,</hi> or the Confederates, the time to deliberate loſt him that of Action: or finally, whether it were that Fortune, which favours things in their growth, pleaſes her ſelf in forſaking them in their maturities, he was vanquiſh'd at <hi>Lipſic;</hi> and the loſs of this Battel made the Empire decline to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards its ruine. More than half <hi>Germany</hi> was ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to the <hi>Swede;</hi> the Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi> ſeiz'd on <hi>Bohemia;</hi> the <hi>Lantgrave</hi> of <hi>Heſs</hi> caſt himſelf on the ſide of the Victor; the Elector of <hi>Triers</hi> ſought pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of the <hi>French,</hi> and the danger ſeem'd ſo great to the Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> that he ſtagger'd in his fidelity
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:62940:57"/>to the Common Cauſe, and the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria.</hi> 'Twas believed alſo, that the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> might have ended the War by the Conqueſt of the Heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Provinces, if he had turn'd his Force thither after this Battel: but truly, without reflecting on what might be ſaid to the contrary, humane Counſel ſeems to be ſubjected to a Superiour cauſe, that excuſes its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects; and in all actions there is often a fatality, that overbears Prudence or blinds it. In the mean time, <hi>Guſtavus</hi> being buſied in the taking in the <hi>Mein</hi> and <hi>Rhein,</hi> thoſe of <hi>Vienna</hi> ſeeing he did not march that way, having leiſure to diſmiſs their Fears, employ'd themſelves with diligence to find ready and apt Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies for theſe Evils, and after many Conſultations, the extremity of their Affairs obliged them to have recourſe to <hi>Walſtein,</hi> who only ſeem'd capable to re-eſtabliſh them, if he would undertake it. They conſider'd his Courage, augmented by Difficulties, far from being terrified by them; induſtrious and paſſionate to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute what others held impoſſible; his active Vigilance never ſurpriz'd; his Riches, proper to facilitate great deſigns, and ready to ſuccour the neceſſities of the Empire; his Credit, his Intelligences, and the deſire the Souldier had to ſerve under him. And as it is the fault of our Nature to hold no mean, neither in Proſperity nor in Affliction, thoſe to whom his Vertue had been intolerable then, when he ſeem'd uſeleſs, prais'd in him in this preſſing occaſion even things vain and fortuitous. They believed moreover, that he would return to his employment with an extream ſatisfaction; that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever diſguſt he had in loſing it, his Ambition, which was the Maſter of his other Paſſions, would ſtifle his reſentment; that this his obſtinate cleaving to a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate life, had leſs of truth than oſtentation. On theſe and the like Conſiderations they reſolved to ſhew him ſome aſſured hopes of his re-eſtabliſhment, thereby
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:62940:57"/>to draw from him ſome teſtimony of his deſire thereof: and thought, that by ingaging him to ask that Charge they were willing to give, the Obligation would be leſs, and the Conditions eaſier. To this purpoſe, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtandig the oppoſition of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who would never conſent, they diſpatch'd <hi>Maximilian Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtein,</hi> Maſter of the Horſe to the King of <hi>Hungary,</hi> having firſt inſtructed him in what they thought ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary: for beſides that he was his Nephew, he was one of thoſe he treated with moſt eſteem and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. He then goes to viſit him at <hi>Zeman,</hi> where he remain'd after the loſs of <hi>Prague;</hi> and after he had entertain'd him with a general diſcourſe of the Affairs of the Empire, that he might be the leſs able to penetrate the aim of his diſcourſe, he dextrouſly turns his Speech on the Praiſes that were beſtow'd on him in the preſent occurrence, and upon the deſire all people had to ſee him again undertake the defence of the Empire; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſing him not to reject the occaſion, but to go forward towards that Fame that attended him. <hi>Walſtein</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived well the Artifice; wherefore minding, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his projects, to hide his deſign more carefully now he ſaw it ready to take effect; and to draw all advantages from the neceſſity of Affairs, he firſt, touching his Intereſt, anſwer'd ſparingly and modeſtly; then extended his diſcourſe unto the ſweetneſs of his condition, and the deſire he had to grow Old in quiet; no more to tempt that Fortune which had treated him ſo ſhamefully, that though ſhe were minded to give him all again, yet it muſt be by robbing him of his Repoſe: and coming at laſt to deplore the Misfortunes of his Sovereign, as if he had been deeply affected, he mingled with his diſcourſe tender and doubtful words; ſuch as might not wholly take off the hopes of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, but repreſent it almoſt impoſſible.</p>
            <pb n="112" facs="tcp:62940:58"/>
            <p>Now, the Miniſters of the Emperour ſeeing they had advanc'd little by this means, preſs'd with time and danger, ſerv'd themſelves of the only way which remain'd; to act openly, to intreat, to offer, to yield to any thing that they might bend him. The Baron of <hi>Queſtemburgh</hi> and the Count <hi>Wardemburgh,</hi> his Friends, attempted him ſeveral times, but in vain. His obſtinacy appear'd ſo great, that they had deſpair'd to overcome it, if the Prince of <hi>Echamberg</hi> had not labour'd in it. And 'twas to him all men expected <hi>Walſtein</hi> ſhould yield, having lived a long time with him in the ſtraiteſt confidence, and always powerfully ſerv'd him at Court; imploying all his diligences to prevent his Fall, and in his diſgrace never grew cold. They conſider'd alſo the Authority of this man; powerful over the inclinations of the Emperour, whoſe Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor and Favourite he was. And certainly his Favour was not ill plac'd; the greatneſs of his Merit going even with that of his Fortune. He then cauſed himſelf to be carried to <hi>Zenam,</hi> being much vexed with the Gout; and after he had given <hi>Walſtein</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours Letters, dictated as the preſent occurrence would; he lively repreſented the Honour of ſaving his Prince and Countrey; the obligation they muſt have to him; the beauty of ſuch an Enterprize; the Fame, and what elſe might ſtir up a mind paſſionate of Glory. He ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Intreaties of <hi>Ferdinand;</hi> that he was Arbiter of all; that he might diſpenſe; that he might act; with aſſurances he ſhould find an entire Obedience, and great Recompences: engaging for that the Credit of the Emperour and his own, which he knew to be great, and had ever prov'd it certain.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Walſtein,</hi> though he ſaw that it was time to cloſe, yet at firſt deny'd his aſſiſtance, though in a fainter manner than ordinary: oppoſing, as in doubt, the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of his Enemies, ready to calumniate what he
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:62940:58"/>might do; the facility of the Emperour to believe them, and perhaps to caſt him off after he had drawn Service from him: And beſides, though he might be ſecur'd in theſe particulars, he asked, where was the Army whereof they would make him General; and what means to ſet right a deſperate Affair. But at laſt, ſeeing himſelf inceſſantly preſs'd, ſometimes feigning to acquieſs in their perſwaſions; ſometimes, to give way to the importunity of his Friends, he promis'd his Service; but for Four months only: in which time he would be ſole and abſolute; and that ended, lay down this burthenous Authority; to which <hi>Echamberg</hi> conſented; believing 'twas enough he had engag'd him to the Imployment, in which the occaſions them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves might oblige him to continue, if his Ambition did not; ſo having conſulted of what they thought needful, after this final Reſolution they departed. <hi>Walſtein</hi> being left alone, unquiet and raving, began to revolve in his mind the greatneſs and difficulty of that which he was about to undertake; ſometimes meaſuring it by Fear, which renders every thing hard; ſometimes by Ambition, which finds nothing ſo. The impoſſibility of uſurping a Kingdom from a legitimate Prince; and of ingaging to Rebellion a People, that make Obedience to their Sovereign a point of their Religion; the danger of truſting ſuch a Secret; the ordinary infidelity of Factious minds; the puniſhment and Infamy; if it did not ſucced; if it did, the Murthers, Poyſons, and diſtruſt of all things terrefied him. On the other ſide, his reſentment of his ill uſage; his hatred, appetite of Revenge, and above all, his covetouſneſs of Rule, which could never be extinct in his unruly mind, blindly precipitated him. He ſaw the half of <hi>Germany</hi> under the King of <hi>Sweden;</hi> the reſt tottering and ill aſſur'd; the Princes of <hi>Europe</hi> Leagu'd with <hi>Guſtavus,</hi> or Ill-willers to the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria;</hi> this Houſe in decline: And
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:62940:59"/>he judg'd by theſe Conjunctures, the time ripe for No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty. He well knew, that extremity of Affairs only having forc'd the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> and the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> powerful at <hi>Vienna,</hi> to conſent to his re-eſtabliſhment, he could expect no other recompence of his pains, if he ſhould ſettle the Empire, than to return to his Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate condition, and to a ſhameful and obſcure life: wherefore he thought it more juſt to ſerve himſelf of thoſe Forces his Enemies had put into his hands, in venturing to ruine them and to raiſe himſelf, than to ſecure them and to loſe himſelf. He thought he had the opportunity and the means. He conſider'd himſelf conſummate in the experience of Military Affairs; dear to the Souldier; ready to command a mercenary Army; hardy, opulent, and induſtrious; always ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour'd of Fortune: whereas he look'd upon the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour as ſlothful; little addicted to Arms; of a ſoft Nature; ſlow, expos'd to deceits, and more proper to diſſemble Injuries than to repulſe them. In this violent agitation, floating in doubts, ſometimes em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing the beſt reſolutions, ſometimes the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious; after he had a long time ſuffer'd theſe tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, he abandon'd himſelf at laſt to the worſt Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, and determin'd to attempt the uſurpation of <hi>Bohemia;</hi> not being able to vanquiſh the motions of his vext and ulcerated mind, nor reſiſt that cruel paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for Greateſs, which never left him in repoſe. But ſeeing, that the execution of ſuch a deſign depended on the diſpoſing of ſeveral things that muſt be publick and interpreted, being naturally fram'd to diſſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and feignings, he reſolv'd, without admitting any Confident of this his laſt reſolution, to bury it under a profound Silence, and to apply himſelf intirely to act in ſuch a manner, that all he did ſhould ſeem to tend to the good of the Empire; to the end that his deſigns not being ſuſpected at firſt, they ſhould not be able to
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:62940:59"/>ruine the beginnings, that are uſually weak: and that when they ſhould come to be diſcover'd, he might be in a condition to carry them on by force. Being thus confirm'd againſt the danger, and reſign'd intirely to ſomething more powerful than his Reaſon; whether you will call it Fate or Genius; he began inſenſibly to drive on his ends, for which he had need of much Time, great Fortune, and many Artifices. And this was the ſtate of things and the deſign of <hi>Walſtein,</hi> when he was recall'd to his Imployment. After this, to put the Affairs of the Emperour in reputation, who had ſcarce any left; and to relieve the people in their Fears by raiſing a belief in them, that this ſide wanted only a Commander, and not Forces; willing alſo to build up a great Opinion of himſelf, he gives out Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions to levy ſixty Regiments; treats with the King of <hi>Poland</hi> for twenty thouſand <hi>Coſſacks;</hi> negotiates with the Duke of <hi>Lorain</hi> to engage him in the War; ſends into <hi>Italy</hi> to buy the beſt Arms, and every where ſows Reports advantagious for his Party. And to the end, that the ſucceſs might not deceive his Attempts, and that with more facility he might aſſemble his Troops, who were to be the ſource of his ſecond Greatneſs, he choſe the Territory of <hi>Znaim</hi> to form the Body of his Army in: inclin'd to it by the commodious ſcituation on the Confines of <hi>Moravia</hi> and the Hereditary Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces; where, notwithſtanding the <hi>Swediſh</hi> War, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance and Peace had remain'd, and where the fury of the Enemy and the Domeſtick miſchiefs of Winter quarter had not penetrated. In this place, whilſt he wrote civilly to the Colonels, diſſembling his natural Fierceneſs, treating them with marks of Courteſy and Friendſhip, adding largeſs and profuſion, ſparing nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Care nor Coyn, Souldiers flocking to him upon his Credit; he rais'd in two Months an Army, if not anſwering the Fame in number, yet 'twas more than
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:62940:60"/>could have been expected: aided in this by voluntary Contributions of the principal Miniſters of <hi>Vienna;</hi> great for the particulars, but made more conſiderable by the neceſſity; ſupplying out of his own Money for the poorer Officers, and ingaging the Richer by his addreſs to raiſe Troops with theirs, feeding them with hopes of recovering all out of the riches of Prey and Garriſons.</p>
            <p>When he ſaw all was ready, caſting himſelf again within his wonted Artifices, he wrote to <hi>Vienna,</hi> that he had ſatisfied his Promiſe, and that now he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire; that the Army was ready, but he wiſh'd Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick Peace; that they ſhould ſend a General and grant him a retirement. He knew for all this, that what he as'kd was impoſſible: for having put into imployment the Captains he retain'd in his diſgrace; given Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to his Kinſmen and ancient Confidents, under pretence of ſparing the principal Pay, and training up new Souldiers under old Commanders, obliging the Colonels to hazard all they had upon the ſole hopes of his Parol; winning the Chief Officers by high Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, corrupting the Souldiers by Preſents, and all men in general by the expectation of his Fortune; he had ſo order'd things, that this Army could not ſubſiſt without him, and reduc'd the Emperour to an abſolute neceſſity of maintaining him General.</p>
            <p>When they knew at <hi>Vienna,</hi> that he perſiſted to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie diſlike of the Service, the Miniſters of <hi>Spain</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> attempted once more to take his Command from him. The firſt, who govern'd the King of <hi>Hungary</hi> by means of his Wife, abſolute up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Spirit, and depending wholly on their Counſels, took this occaſion to render that Prince Maſter of Arms and of Affairs. The Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> fear'd to ſee the Command in the hands of him whom he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoil'd of it. They urg'd both of them, that the Power
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:62940:60"/>confer'd on <hi>Walſtein</hi> caus'd the Revolt, and 'twould confirm the Rebellion, if it were renew'd, and make thoſe contrive to revolt, who hitherto remain'd faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; that the preſence of the King of <hi>Hungary</hi> would lead Princes and People back to their Allegiance, who would be aſham'd to bear Arms againſt the Son of their Sovereign, and who muſt one day be ſo: beſides, what opinion would <hi>Europe</hi> entertain of the Succeſſour to the Empire, if he ſhould be depriv'd of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand? And what greater Argument of the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Empire, than ſhamefully to betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to a man, who deſign'd Misfortunes to it? That this was to condemn of Imprudence the laſt Councils, and expoſe themſelves afreſh and voluntarily to dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers; that under pretence of Publick good they ought not to truſt <hi>Walſtein,</hi> nor put him in condition to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge the Injuries he believed to have receiv'd, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſince a deſign of Rule might be mixt with his appetite of Revenge, and our Fidelities hardly defend themſelves againſt theſe two; that this man was proud and immoderate; that he every day ſcatter'd new marks of his Indignation, and that in his retreat at <hi>Prague</hi> he had meditated nothing but dangerous and vaſt deſigns; diſſimulation and revenge.</p>
            <p>But theſe Conſiderations, though pregnant, gave way to the neceſſity of imploying him for the conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the new Army, the chief ſupport of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial party. <hi>Ferdinand</hi> himſelf calling to mind in his preſent calamity, the formidable eſtate wherein this General had once plac'd him; as it is ordinary for the unhappy to ſuffer themſelves to be blinded with the weakeſt hopes, flatter'd himſelf with thoughts of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trieving his former Greatneſs, and ſecur'd himſelf of the Fears they endeavour'd to inſtill. Beſides, his Council, jealous of the direction of the Affairs of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> went about to uſurp;
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:62940:61"/>hoping that <hi>Walſtein</hi> joyning with them, might uphold their credit, favour'd his Cauſe and declar'd, that the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> had need of him; that 'twas ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to reſerve the Emperour for laſt extremities, and not fit to expoſe the welfare of his ſtate to the Youth and Courage of his Son, eſpecially in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture wherein they could not err twice, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in full experience of the Military Art was ſcarce ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient. They added, that the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed good deſigns, becauſe 'tis natural to hate thoſe we have wrong'd, and that he preſer'd his private Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the general good; that he would ſtrip the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of its beſt defence, the more eaſily to betray it. For at this time the Loyalty of this Elector became ſuſpected, and by intercepted Letters they found, that he manag'd a Peace with the <hi>Swede.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus the care of the War was put upon <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtein:</hi> but as all his feigned coolneſs was only to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Advantages on which he might found his Uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, perceiving that they did not act ſincerely, and that the hatred of his Enemies gave way only to the deſpair of their Affairs, ready to break out again, when they could ruine him ſecurely; that the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> ſeem'd conſtrain'd, and that his words were by ſo much the leſs real, as they were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement and common in fear; he confirms himſelf in his reſolution of maintaining his Authority by fraud and by force, believing he could do nothing unjuſt againſt his mortal Enemies.</p>
            <p>And now, after many Inſtances, having declar'd, that he was ready to do what they would, provided they furniſh'd him with what was neceſſary; <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamberg</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Vienna,</hi> who were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd with ample power to grant him any thing, urging him to declare what he deſir'd, as one that accepted of a weighty Charge, and ask'd only ſuch
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:62940:61"/>things as might aid him to overcome the difficulties of it, with much confidence he told them, that ſeveral reaſons would have forbid him accepting the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand wherein he was ingag'd, if the love of his Countrey and deſire to ſerve his Prince had not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul'd them; that he had already imployed his Eſtate; that he was ready to hazard his life alſo; that they would have him add his Honour, which he eſteem'd above Riches or Life; that he was upon the point to begin a War, in which 'twas raſhneſs to hope a good ſucceſs; with a Great and War-like King, hitherto Arbiter of Victory and Fortune, againſt whom he ſhould only oppoſe new and vanquiſh'd Souldiers; that he could expect nothing from the weakneſs of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, the diviſion of its Councils, the falſeneſs of its Allies; that he found he was the mark of Hatred and Envy; that in this condition, where every thing was againſt him, and he had nothing but his Virtue to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage him, they expected with impatience the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of his Imployment; that if good men wiſh'd him proſperous, becauſe he labour'd for the Publick good, his Enemies long'd for his ruine, which they prefer'd to their cauſe, prepar'd to accuſe him as guilty, if he fail'd to be happy, and to impute to him as Crimes the faults of Fortune. That for theſe Reaſons it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hov'd him to ſee, that good men might not be deceiv'd; that Malice might be diſappointed, and his Honour preſerv'd; and that it was but fit, that thoſe who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his mind had call'd him to ſuch difficulties, ſhould grant him what they, as well as himſelf, muſt judge neceſſary to his preſent condition, and without which they would ruine the Affairs of the Empire, and his Reputation.</p>
            <p>After this diſcourſe, which in appearance was ſo much the more innocent, as it ſeem'd free and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſſed, he gave them Articles containing, That
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:62940:62"/>they made him General of the <hi>Auſtrian</hi> Armies, and Arbiter of Peace, with an intire, abſolute and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent Power; that the King of <hi>Hungary</hi> ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver come to the Army; that he might by his private Authority, and without communicating with the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> or the Chamber of <hi>Spire,</hi> diſpoſe of Confiſcations, Permiſſions and Graces; and that the Hereditary Countries ſhould be appointed for the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter quarters of his Army.</p>
            <p>Theſe Conditions were hard, and <hi>Walſtein</hi> to excuſe them alledged, That great Enterprizes were ſcarce ever ſucceſsful, but under the Conduct of one man; that often the iſſue had been unfortunate where many were mingled in Command; that the <hi>Romans,</hi> when they had chas'd away their Kings, were forc'd in the dangers of their Commonwealth to create Dictatours; that <hi>Guſtavus</hi> acting alone, on weak beginnings found himſelf Victorious beyond his hopes; that on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, a multitude of Maſters had loſt the beſt Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers of the World, and brought the Empire almoſt to its ſubverſion; that this Example was enough to let us ſee, how weak Power becomes when 'tis divided; that the fear of Shame and deſire of Glory made us act vigorouſly, ſo long as they touch'd none but our ſelves, but when they were in common, we neglected that reputation and that blame, whereof little would come to our ſhare. He imploy'd the like Reaſons for Negotiations of Peace, where number hurts the ſecret; where different Intereſts and divers Conducts hood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wink Prudence, retarding or diverting opportunities of Treating. He added, that it would not be advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious the King of <hi>Hungary</hi> ſhould Command in the Army, nor fit he ſhould Obey; that 'twas not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Souldiers ſhould leave the Service, and go to ſeek Rewards of their pains at Court, where their Faces were ſcarce known, and where ordinarily for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:62940:62"/>men and Flatterers diſguiſed Truth, decry'd the beſt Actions, and uſurp'd the place of Merit; that 'twas neceſſary Rewards and Puniſhments ſhould be preſent in Armies, if we would preſerve Order and gain Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; that there were no Souldiers, that fight for a ſteril Fame; that the deſire of Gain and Greatneſs drew them to the War; that their Blood was the price of their Fortune; that the tranſport of our Paſſions being the cauſe of our Crimes, the pleaſure of ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying them would turn theſe Crimes into Habits, when not ſeverely chaſtis'd; that upon hopes of Impunity bad men were hardned, Good men corrupted, and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline ruin'd; that he did deſire permiſſion to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh his Winter quarters in the Hereditary Provinces, only to ſerve himſelf of it in extremity, and to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his Army, if he ſhould be reduc'd to that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, other parts of <hi>Germany</hi> being harras'd and poſſeſt by the Enemy; that he ſhould endeavour by all ways to Winter elſewhere, but if the fortune of Arms, always doubtful, ſhould draw the War in length, as 'twas probable, or if Fortune ſhould continue laviſhly to favour the worſt ſide, they ought reſolve to ſuffer this moderated inconvenience, unleſs they had a mind to ſee the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Troops pillage the Provinces, and the Heritage of <hi>Caeſars</hi> become a prey to the Barbarous.</p>
            <p>Though all this appear'd neceſſary and innocent, yet the thoughts of <hi>Walſtein</hi> aim'd further, and tended to graſp a Dictatorſhip in the Empire, that he might render <hi>Ferdinand</hi> deſpicable, deſpoil'd of his Majeſty, and reduc'd to a perfect Idleneſs; and alſo to accuſtome the Souldier to acknowledge him their only Maſter: every one ordinarily fixing his Servitude to the preſent fear or profit; and does not wonder to ſee the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty uſurp'd by him that acts all, from him that vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily fitting ſtill, ſeems to have given it away to the more worthy.</p>
            <pb n="122" facs="tcp:62940:63"/>
            <p>Now, the better to cover his intentions, and to ſhew that he did not ſtretch his deſigns beyond thoſe of a Private man, after his Propoſitions that regarded the Publick, he made others for himſelf; earneſtly urging, that the reward of what Service he ſhould do, might be aſſign'd him in <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and that his reſtitution to the Dukedom of <hi>Meckleburgh</hi> ſhould be compriz'd in any Treaty of Peace that might be made: as if he dreamt of nothing, but to joyn himſelf to, and depend more than ever upon the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria;</hi> limiting his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition and his hopes to the bare recovery of his anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Dignity. Praying further, that if they ſhould call him off from his Service, he might have ſix Months warning, to prepare himſelf, as he ſaid, to retire with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſorder: whether it were to make them believe, that holding his Authority as a thing indifferent and uncertain, he was far from any thoughts of keeping it by force; or whether he deſir'd to have this warning given him, that he might be the better able to carry his deſigns to their ends without precipitation, if he ſound himſelf oblig'd to it.</p>
            <p>After they had granted him every thing, the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> accommodating themſelves to Affairs, and, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the time, feigning Joy for his re-eſtabliſhment, ſent him their Order of the <hi>Fleece,</hi> as a publick mark of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and good-will. However, that their proceeding might not be ſuſpected of diſſimulation or weakneſs, and that they might not ſeem totally to abandon their Pretentions to rule in <hi>Germany,</hi> they propos'd, that after the recovery of <hi>Behemia,</hi> the King of <hi>Hungary</hi> ſhould remain at <hi>Prague</hi> with an Army capable to defend that Kingdom, and to maintain it in Peace and Obedience.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Walſtein</hi> applauded this Overture (though he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived whither it tended) being certain to hinder the execution, and condeſcended, fearing leſt they ſhould augure ill from his refuſing. The Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> for
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:62940:63"/>his part, fearing to draw the implacable hatred of his ancient Enemy upon his Countrey, bow'd to the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, and choſe the leaſt Evil, breaking off his plotted accommodation with the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> and ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted anew to the Fortune of the Empire.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, the Court of <hi>Vienna</hi> was buſied in publick proceſſions, and paid Vows for the ſucceſs of an Army deſtin'd to its ruine. But <hi>Walſtein</hi> perſwaded, that whilſt they acted nothing, they addreſt themſelves in vain to Heaven, which hates the Prayers of the ſloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; and on the contrary, that he could not fail of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs whilſt he acted with vigilance, diligence and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, buſied himſelf only to haſten the preparatives to his deſign, and attended his good Fortune.</p>
            <p>The mention I have made of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> at <hi>Vien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> minds me to ſay ſomething of them in a few words, and only for the clearing of the matter. When <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth had ſhar'd to his Family the Empire and the Kingdom of <hi>Spain,</hi> his Succeſſours remaining in the Union, believ'd it was their intereſt to make the ſame Peace, the ſame War, to have the ſame Alliances; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever concern'd the Greatneſs of their Houſe being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to them; and after they had conſulted together for the publick benefit they acted apart, and each did his own buſineſs. <hi>Rodolphus</hi> and <hi>Matthias</hi> did thus. But the Troubles of <hi>Germany</hi> oblig'd <hi>Ferdinand</hi> to implore, with more importunity than ordinary, the power of the <hi>Spaniard:</hi> they valued themſelves upon his eaſineſs and the urgency of the occaſion, to ſeize on the office of his Miniſters, and would themſelves have the government and diſpoſal of thoſe aids of Men or Moneys wherewith they aſſiſted him. As this firſt Uſurpation took effect, they fortified themſelves in the Emperours Council by Penſions and Preſents, ſo that at length nothing was done without them. Afterwards their Embaſſadour had a particular Council to deliberate of that which

               <hi>Walſtein</hi> having laid ſo happily the foundation of his Revolt, deliberates to prolong the War, that he might have time to gain the Souldiers, to ruine the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> by the <hi>Swedes,</hi> to weaken the Hereditary Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces by Winter quarters, and at leaſure to make his Peace with the Enemies of his Maſter.

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Remember that in my firſt years of Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, at all Academical Aſſemblies, or Private Meetings of young Students, great things were ſaid of that Love of <hi>Plato,</hi> which raviſhes the mind from vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible beauties to inviſible. No ſort of Argument was more familiar in all mens mouths; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing furniſh'd Poets with more propitious matter; nothing ſuggeſted to Oratours a more benign Subject. Wherefore, not to ſeem a Stranger amongſt ſo many Citizens of <hi>Plato</hi>'s Commonwealth, I betook my ſelf with a great deal of fervour to look into the reverenc'd Memorials of that worthy Philoſopher; and found, that the <hi>Pla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="126" facs="tcp:62940:65"/>The ſame hath hapned to me concerning <hi>Style.</hi> What word amongſt the Learned and Unlearned, more dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick than this? Who is not bold to judge of it? who does not pronounce definitive Sentences, condemning the greateſt Authors who have labour'd for Praiſe? This hath no Style, his Style is too rough; 'tis a difficult Style, that is conſus'd, and the other is harſh. I weep over the unhappy condition of the Learned, who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps dare not ſuffer their Pens to take a flight through the unknown fields of Poſterity, ſeeing the Heaven of the preſent Age thus darkned with clouds of Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and Envy, which thunder upon Hiſtorians, light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en in the face of Oratours, and blaſt the Bays upon the venerable Heads of Poets. I made it my task there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to ſearch among the Writings of the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Latins,</hi> and try if I could eſtabliſh in my mind with any clearneſs what <hi>Style</hi> is, in what it is placed, of what parts it is compos'd, or rather from the conjunction of what pieces it reſults.</p>
            <p>If the Science which God at firſt infus'd were tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Sons of <hi>Adam,</hi> as well as the Sin which he contracted is propagated, Mankind would have no need of any other Inſtrument for the full knowledge of things, than the Names by which they were call'd. For though the Divine light participated to <hi>Adam,</hi> ſerv'd to many and noble effects, yet in this it ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly ſhin'd forth, that letting him perfectly know the Eſſence of Created things, he could impoſe a Name upon every one of them, which efficaciouſly expreſt their Nature; ſo that every Name might be call'd, the Definition of the thing named. But becauſe in that woful Patrimony, inherited by his unhappy Poſterity, the plague of <hi>Ignorance</hi> is not the leaſt; we bewail the loſs of Infallible Science together with Original Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs; and wandring through the uncertain and deceitful paths of a cloudy Philoſophy, we puzzle
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:62940:65"/>our ſelves amongſt ſhadows of Names, to arrive the beſt we may at the brightneſs of Truth and Eſſences. Wherefore, according to the beſt Examples, let us ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt our conſideration upon the Name.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Stylus,</hi> according to its Natural ſenſe, was nothing elſe but an Inſtrument, ſharp at one end and broad at the other, which was us'd to write Characters in Waxen Table-books, or to cancel what was written. From the material Inſtrument with which they wrote, the ſignification was afterwards transfer'd to the act of Writing, that is, to the uſe and exerciſe of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument. It was likewiſe appropriated to Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and in this ſenſe 'tis moſt frequently us'd. And becauſe the office of a judicious Author is double, to Write and to Correct, this laſt is recommended by <hi>Quintilian,</hi> who preſcribes the uſe of that part of the Style which is leſs acute, and which ſerv'd to cancel the Characters. The ſharp end of the Style had alſo its Allegorical ſignification: for when they would note a Book for being Bitter and Satyrical, they ſpoke of his Style, not as of an Inſtrument of Writing, but as of Arms which pierced and wounded.</p>
            <p>None of theſe Conſiderations can lead us to that knowledge of Style we ſeek; but there is one place in <hi>Terence</hi> which goes a little further: for he uſes the word <hi>Style</hi> ſo, as it is not reſtrain'd to ſignifie a bare Compoſition, but comprehends beſides a certain par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular quality or, manner of Compoſing. 'Tis once us'd by <hi>Cieero</hi> in the ſame ſenſe, and afterwards fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently by Authors of leſs Fame. But though many took Style for a quality of, or manner us'd in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing, yet none have declared what it is, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd Rules for it. So that we muſt proceed in our Inquiry.</p>

            <p>The uſe of Speech was given to man for the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Reaſon: and if we were what we ought to be, the ſimplicity of natural Speaking were enough to perſwade to Goodneſs, and when the Underſtanding had Truth any way repreſented to it, without any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticements of flattering Eloquence, it would run to imbrace it; and the Will, freely bound by the naked, but efficacious propoſal of what is good, would feel it ſelf raviſh'd to a liking of it, without expecting the Artificial engines of an Elegant diſcourſe. But becauſe 'tis long ſince that the vigour of our Innocency was enervated, Art ſtrives to come in with its aids to the relief of oppreſſed Nature; and hath in its Schools compos'd two ſorts of Remedies. The one violent, call'd the moving of the Affection, which does not work but by a notable alteration of the Patient: The other pleaſant, call'd Elocution, in whoſe company Perſwaſion does ſweetly inſtil it ſelf into the mind. Both of them manag'd by the Maſters of the Art, not as laudable in themſelves, but as neceſſary to the Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of the Auditors. The laſt only ſerves to our propoſed end.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Elocution</hi> is generally divided into two parts, Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Ornament. Perhaps he would ſay the ſame, that bids us take care <hi>ut verba ſint Latina, aperta, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nata. Latina,</hi> that they do not break the Laws of received Grammar, nor recede from the ſenſe given them by the moſt Fam'd Authors, nor be rude and uncultivate. <hi>Aperta,</hi> by propriety and uſe, ſhunning improper ones, and ſuch as are not commonly us'd by good Authors. <hi>Ornata,</hi> with figures, call'd Tropes and Schemes by the <hi>Greeks.</hi> But if Elocution conſiſts only in the choice of Words, and in the ornament given them by Figures, we cannot rightly call it Style, not will the body of a Diſcourſe be enobled by it only, as it ought. It ſeems to me, that Words (whether in
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:62940:66"/>their own nature elegant, or rais'd to a forein ſenſe by uſing them figuratively) are like Stones which are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd for a ſtately Building. For, whether they are precious themſelves (as Marble ſpotted or ſincere) or curiouſly wrought by a Chiſſil, if they have not in the ſtructure of the Edifice the ſymmetry which they ought to have, if they do not keep a due diſtance, or want equality of meaſure, they cannot compoſe a beautiful Palace or a ſumptuous Temple. To reduce Elocution then to a perfect Form, 'tis neceſſary that ſomething be added to the Words and Figures, by virtue of which their worth may appear the better in the compoſition; which is done by a judicious placing of them; wherein an eye muſt be had to the Subject which is handled by us. For, as noble and elevate Conceits occur in vain to the mind, if they do not meet with an excellent Elocution, which can fortunate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſplay them: ſo a treaſure of excellent Words and ingenious Figures little avail, if they are not both call'd out to their proper places by a diſcreet Collocation. Thus Elocution being confin'd within too narrow bounds by thoſe, who reſtrain it to the propriety and ornament of Words; further inquiring into what the Maſters of the beſt taſt have ſaid concerning it, we find that they recommend Elegance, Compoſition, and Dignity. Under the firſt name of <hi>Elegance</hi> is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the <hi>Latiniſm</hi> of the <hi>Romans, Heleniſm</hi> of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and <hi>Tuſcaniſm</hi> of the <hi>Italians,</hi> and ſo propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionately according to the Language; by which they mean certainly in the Grammar Rules of that Age; clearneſs, by the uſe of received Words, and proper to the matter they handle. The ſecond word, <hi>Compoſition,</hi> expreſſes the good placing of Words and Periods a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelves. The third, <hi>Dignity,</hi> ſignifies the ornament which the Writing recives from Figures, which conſiſt either in Words or regard the Sentence.</p>
            <pb n="130" facs="tcp:62940:67"/>
            <p>To draw now the moſt general virtues of <hi>Elocution</hi> into a Compendium: Let it be firſt Pure; that it does not trip in the path of Grammar. And that it not only be at diſtance from Vice or Errour, but as much as may be, approach that Vertue which may render the Compoſition without exception chaſt and correct. Let it be clear and perſpicuous: and this perſpicuity is chiefly deriv'd from the propriety of it. We muſt acknowledge for an undoubted Truth, that thoſe who Writers, refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the way trodden by good Authors, practiſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us'd Forms, do ſo intreague Elocution, that the poor Reader finds his path intangled, nor can free his feet from thoſe Enigma's which retard him. An Errour common to the Writers of our times, who think then they are Witty, <hi>Si ad eos intelligendos opus ſit ingenio.</hi> But becauſe facility in a diſcourſe for the moſt part borders upon meanneſs, we muſt look that it be clear and eaſie, but that diſcretion preſcribe a meaſure, that it does not become low and groveling. To this we muſt add Ornament, which proceeds from an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune managing of the Figures, whether they are of Words or Sentences. It muſt not be effeminate or laſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>civious; but as <hi>Quintilian</hi> ſaith, <hi>Virilis, fortis &amp; San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus.</hi> Alſo that ſort of Ornament muſt be choſen, that fits the nature of the diſcourſe. For one kind becomes the Hiſtorian, another the Poet, another the Oratour: or rather none of theſe muſt be always uniform, but vary habit as the matter requires. In <hi>Elocution</hi> alſo regard muſt be had to the Sound and Numbers. For, though Number principally appertains to Verſe, yet for all that, Proſe hath its proportionate Numbers diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from the Poetical, whereof the Ear that hath contracted a good habit is the beſt Judge. And in this particular it were to be wiſh'd, that ſome Modern Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors bore more reſpect to the Ears of underſtanding men: for we ſee a form of Diſcourſe introduc'd, abrupt
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:62940:67"/>and loud, which like Water broke off in the midſt of its courſe by Stones, wonderfully offends the hearing. In the laſt place, let it be well plac'd or diſpos'd. Hence ſprings the dependance and joynting of Members and Periods. Whence thoſe who work their pieces <hi>ala Muſaico</hi> may perceive, that forming a Diſcourſe made up of bits, not chain'd together, but broken and no way correſpondent, make a Garment of divers Snips ill ſtitch'd together, but do not weave a regular and uniform piece. Every three words a Period. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Period a Sentence, which does not agree with what went before, nor calls for that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.</p>
            <p>Whatever I have ſaid of <hi>Elocution,</hi> I cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve that the <hi>Style</hi> we are in ſearch of, conſiſts in it. 'Tis true we have laid a Foundation, but all the parts of an entire building are not in the Foundation. We muſt paſs on therefore: For if to the conſtituting <hi>Style</hi> the three kinds or Characters of Writing are neceſſary, then Elocution alone is not enough. Elocution, though in its perfection, if it be without the Characters, forms, or Idea's of Speech, remains idle and indetermin'd. For if a diſcourſe were to be examin'd by the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Rules of Elocution, many things would remain unexamin'd, becauſe they do not belong to the Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, but to the Character or Idea.</p>
            <p>The Characters of Speech are three; the Sublime, the Humble, and the Temperate. <hi>Homer</hi> is ſaid to have excellently obſerv'd this diſtinction in three prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal perſons of his Poem. To <hi>Menelaus</hi> he attributes a mode of Reaſoning altogether ſincere and reſtrain'd, without ſuperfluity; which is the vertue of the Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Character; whilſt words, they ſaid, flow'd out of <hi>Neſtors</hi> mouth more ſweet than Honey, and regards the Temperate. But to expreſs the Sublime, in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> he compoſes ſuch an ample and ſtately
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:62940:68"/>Eloquence, as is compared to a Torrent inrich'd and grown proud by melted Snow.</p>
            <p>There is no Subject which may not laudably be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nag'd with diverſity of Character. That Almighty God, who hath the Seat of his Glory upon the back of Cherubins; and ſometimes carried upon the Wings of the Wind, ſometimes in a Triumphal Chariot to which Seraphims ſerve for Wheels, and paſſes over the immenſe Fields of the Heavens; what matter does not this furniſh to the Sublimity of diſcourſe we find in <hi>Ezekiel</hi> and <hi>Iſaiah?</hi> But the ſame God, whilſt he ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers the Souls of the Faithful, as a Hen gathers her Chickens, and under the Wings of his gracious Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction keeps and defends them, humbles himſelf under the ſimplicity of Conceit and Character, with which, for all that, his infinite Majeſty is not diminiſh'd or offended. Who more magnificently reaſons of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine things than the <hi>Areopagite?</hi> But, who more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voutly diſcourſes of the ſame things than St. <hi>Bernard? Nazianzen</hi> lightens and thunders; as if having put off humanity, he ſtrove to equal the height of his Subject with a Celeſtial facundity. <hi>Anſelmus</hi> ſighs and weeps, and accompanies the ſenſe of his Soul with Humility of thoughts and words.</p>
            <p>Let us add, that certain Authors are endow'd with a Wit and Genius of that nature, that whatever Matter they handle they do it with uniformity of Character; becauſe they are not capable of any variety. Men who write on all Subjects with a Character ſo generous and high, that they cannot ſtoop even in the moſt ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and delicate affections. Let us take the Example from Painting and Sculpture. We ſee in the Pieces of ſome that are univerſally famous, a certain particular Manner that diſtinguiſhes them from others. One is ſo excellent in formiug the tenderneſs of the Fleſh, that he unwillingly encounters a Figure that is robuſt
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:62940:68"/>and nervous; or if he is to draw an <hi>Athlet,</hi> in that vaſtneſs of vigorous Members there will appear the delicateneſs of the Idea, which guided the hand that form'd it: Others, on the contrary, profeſs a way and Manner more reſolute and virile; and theſe know not how to paint a Youth, which ſhall not reſemble <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytus</hi> in Fierceneſs: they cannot paint a Lady but like an <hi>Amazon;</hi> and for all this, their Works are moſt perfect. Of the firſt ſort amongſt the Ancients was <hi>Polictetus,</hi> who form'd humane Statues beautiful to wonder, but never could arrive to beſtow on the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the Gods that Majeſty, or, as <hi>Quintilian</hi> calls it, that weight which is convenient to a Divinity. So it happens to Writers alſo, according to the difference of Genius, or perhaps of Habit which they contract in compoſing. Some, though the Argument be low and vulgar, yet for all that, diſcourſe as magnificently of it as they can: ſo on the contrary, the ſame variety is oſten cauſed by Circumſtances which accompany the Writing. Of a glorious and heroick Exploit in War, may be form'd a Letter, which by way of Advice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts it; a Dialogue which examines it; a Hiſtory that tranſmits it to Poſterity; an Oration that exalts it, and a Poem that ſings it; and who does not ſee with what diverſity of Character this ſole Argument may be commendably handled?</p>

               </head>
               <p>BY all this diſcourſe we do not reach a deciſion of <hi>Style;</hi> for, that it does not conſiſt in theſe three Characters, we may conſider firſt, that if <hi>Style</hi> and <hi>Character</hi> were one, there would be but three ſorts of Style, as there are but three Characters; which is ſo manifeſtly oppos'd to Experience, that we find as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny kinds of Style as there are Writers. Beſides, we find many excellent Authors who write in the ſame Character, which compar'd are of a Style vaſtly diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent; and every one hath his proper excellence, which diſtinguiſhes him from thoſe, from whom he does not differ in the kind or character of Writing. <hi>Virgil</hi> and <hi>Lucan</hi> compos'd their Heroick Poems in the Sublime character, yet they are altogether unlike in Style. Let us add, that the moſt Famous Authors make uſe of all the Characters according to occaſion, yet the Style with which they manage them is the ſame. Nor does <hi>Cicero</hi> vary his Style with his Character, whether he writes a familiar Epiſtle or forms a Dialogue, or treats of Morality, or thunders in an Oration; but by the conſent of all men the <hi>Ciceronian</hi> Style is one and the the ſame. And thus we have found, I think fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately enough, in what Style does not conſiſt, and what it is not: But becauſe to be defin'd by Negations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs only to the Divinity, by reaſon of that infinite exceſs in all the parts of it, which does not ſuffer cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated Underſtanding to comprehend it; let us ſee if we can in Poſitive terms arrive at the Truth we ſeek.</p>
               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:62940:69"/>
               <p>The Precepts, the Art of <hi>Elocution,</hi> the Forms and Characters of Diſcourſe are common to all; but Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which endows men with different Genius, hath ſo order'd it, that every one in the uſe of thoſe Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts poſſeſſes a certain particularity, ſomething peculiar, which ſprings from his proper Genius, by virtue where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of that Elocution, thoſe Forms, that Character in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves common to all Writers become in ſuch manner proper to each one, that one mans Writing is diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd from another by that particularneſs: and this I would call <hi>Style.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thucidides</hi> and <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi> according to the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of all Maſters of the Art, form'd their Writings according to the magnifick or ſublime Character. And not differing in the Character, by conſequence they do not differ in the Form and Elocution, which are the parts whereof Character is compos'd: yet, whoever ſhall read their Works will find in them a mighty diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and ſhall not know wherein it conſiſts. Now this difference ariſes from that particularity which iſſues from the proper Genius of each of them, ſo working that though Character in the kind and the precept be the ſame, yet it is not the ſame in the uſe: ſo that from the Character in conjunction with the individual particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity ſpringing from the uſe of <hi>Thucidides</hi> genius or wit, reſults the Style of <hi>Thucidides;</hi> and from the ſame Character in the application of it, and individual uſe of <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi> reſults the Style of <hi>Demoſthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis on all hands confeſs'd, that Arguments may be drawn from the Writing, if not infallible and neceſſary, at leaſt probable and well grounded, of the affections and manners of the Writer. But this gueſs cannot be founded in the Character; for 'twould be inſufferable faſcity to infer uniformity of paſſions and manners in
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:62940:70"/>thoſe that compoſe in an uniform Character: therefore the illation depends upon ſome other principle more individual and intrinſick. <hi>Virgil</hi> and <hi>Lucan,</hi> for what concerns Character, muſt both be ranked with the Sublime. Now he that in the Works of <hi>Lucan</hi> tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces the manners of the Writer, will eſteem him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rumacious, proud, impatient of Order and Laws; of tumultuous thoughts, precipitous reſolutions; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitated rather by fury than by ſober Counſels; wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, in fine, to be numbred amongſt thoſe that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpir'd againſt <hi>Nero.</hi> On the contrary, <hi>Virgil</hi> will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear always noble and honourable; of pleaſing beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour; of a generous, but temperate mind; an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of all Indignity, tenacious of Decorum; baſhful, but manly. Now if this diverſity hath no foundation in the Character, which is the ſame in both, it muſt have it in that particular manner in the application and uſe of the Character, which is individual to every one, as the Wit which produces it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual, and makes the difference of <hi>Lucans</hi> and <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gils</hi> Style.</p>
               <p>I will add one Conſideration, which, if I am not deceiv'd, ſerves efficaciouſly to diſplay the Opinion I intend to eſtabliſh. In the ſhort ſpace of humane face, by an unconceivable miracle of Nature the ſame parts concur in every one; and in all, they are diſpoſed in the ſame order, placed with correſpondent and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form diſtance; and yet in this likeneſs of parts an entire diſſimilitude of Faces appears. Further, let us imagine a thouſand Faces equally beautiful in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſymmetry of parts and well temper'd colour, yet for all that each of them ſhall have its proper air, which ſhall be enough to diſtinguiſh it from all the reſt. Whence we ſay, this hath a gentle air, this a noble mein. 'Tis certain, the Air does not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:62940:70"/>in the parts ſo order'd and diſpos'd, nor in the Colour temper'd and compos'd after a certain manner, for both one and the other are common to all of them: yea, it oftentimes happens, that a Face which is not fair according to the proprieties appertaining to perfect Beauty, is for all that of a better air, and more amiable than one entirely Beautiful. So that what we vulgarly call the Air of the Face, is a proper and individual quality of each one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing from the particular Complexion, by which it is rendred different from others, in common with which it hath the ſame meaſure and order of Parts, and mixture of Colours. And this, perhaps though underſtood by all men, we know not how to define or expreſs. This Air of the Face anſwers to Style, as the Parts and Colour correſpond with Character; and is perhaps what the Maſters of the Art often name <hi>Orationis Color,</hi> and we may ſtyle the Air of a Compoſition. But it may be ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſimilitude drawn from Art, will better expreſs our intentions, and 'tis taken out of <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Four things are neceſſarily requir'd to render a Painter excellent in his Art: <hi>Deſign, Colour, Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,</hi> and <hi>Cuſtome;</hi> (though for Cuſtome 'tis known of few, and obſerv'd by fewer:) and if a Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er fail in any of theſe parts, he cannot be term'd excellent. <hi>Raphael, Titian,</hi> and <hi>Corregio</hi> poſſeſs'd them all in a ſupream degree: and at this day, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minently, <hi>Giuſeppino, &amp;c.</hi> Wherefore in the mouths of thoſe that underſtand, they paſs for Painters of the firſt Claſſis, and ſuch as fortunately contend with the Ancients. 'Tis certain for all this, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelves they vaſtly differ. Nor can this difference have its original in thoſe things which
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:62940:71"/>have an invariable and common Rule: for they have all a regular deſign; proportionate colour, though not uniform; every one of them preſerves an orderly Compoſition, without confuſion, and all of them ſtudy, as they may, livelily to expreſs Cuſtome; and yet thoſe who underſtand the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the Art, find out a particularity in their Pieces, by virtue of which they know how to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce this Picture is <hi>Giuſeppino's,</hi> this <hi>Guido's, &amp;c.</hi> And to this particularity, by men of the Skill, is given the title of Manner, or Way; whence they ſay the Manner of <hi>Raphael</hi> and the Manner of <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian.</hi> To the <hi>Manner</hi> of Painters we may compare the <hi>Style</hi> of Writers, and ſay as properly, this is the Style of <hi>Saluſt</hi> in <hi>Catelines</hi> Conſpiracy, as this is the Manner of <hi>Raphael,</hi> ſpeaking of a Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture.</p>
               <p>From all that hath been ſaid we may draw theſe Corollaries. Firſt, that Style is a particular and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual manner of Diſcourſing or Writing, ariſing from the particular Genius of each Writer in the application and uſe of the Characters of Diſcourſe. Secondly, Comparing Character with Style, this holds of Nature and Genius, that regards Art and Study. And by conſequence this multiplies and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries according to the number and quality of the Genius's; that remains always divided into three Members, as before we have declared. Thirdly, To ask any one in what Style he writes, is fooliſh; becauſe he cannot compoſe in any other Style than his own, dictated by his Genius: except that through imitation he may ſtudy to expreſs with ſome likeneſs the Style of another; ſo that to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the queſtion proper, we ought to ſay, In what Character does he write; when we do not mean
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:62940:71"/>Imitation. Fourthly, We may ſay, this is the Style of <hi>Thucidides</hi> and <hi>Saluſt;</hi> but we cannot ſay, this is their Character, for 'tis a thing common to all, and not proper to any one, as Style is.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen <hi>Spain</hi> was divided, not only amongſt many Kings, but amongſt many Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and that the <hi>Gothes, Moors,</hi> and <hi>Spaniards</hi> held each a part of it; <hi>Aragon</hi> was under the power of one King, who amidſt the Wars wherewith his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours were buſied, had always maintain'd his Subjects in Peace; and who had nothing remarkable, but his being Father to him whoſe Hiſtory we write. His Wife, when ſhe had given him a Son, left him a Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dower, much about the time that the Counteſs of <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellona,</hi> a young and vertuous Princeſs, loſt her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:62940:73"/>band. Though he was now old, his Council and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects found, that for the ſafety of his Perſon and Eſtate, it were to be wiſh'd he could leave more than one Heir; and pray'd him to that purpoſe, to chooſe a Wife to his mind in his own Countrey, or amongſt his Neighbours. The Beauty and Vertue of the Counteſs were known beyond <hi>Aragon.</hi> And beſides that reaſon of State requir'd, that an occaſion of joyning to his Kingdom a Town ſo important as <hi>Barcellona</hi> ſhould not be loſt, the inclination of the King did entirely carry him to it. <hi>Roſalva</hi> (for ſo ſhe was call'd) was fair enough, and Judicious as ſhe was fair: and finding her ſelf a Sovereign Princeſs, nothing leſs than a Scepter could tempt her to a ſecond Marriage. But having only one Daughter, and the King of <hi>Aragon</hi> but one Son, ſhe believed that it was not only to make her ſelf a Queen, but to leave an hereditary Kingdom to her Daughter: and that being amidſt many Neighbours, who deſign'd upon her State, ſhe could not be blam'd for ſecuring it by putting a Crown upon her head. She eaſily agreed then to loſe the name of Counteſs of <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellona</hi> to be Queen of <hi>Aragon;</hi> and was received with all the Joy and Magnificence poſſible. Being young, fair, and witty, in a ſhort time ſhe abſolutely govern'd the King, and ſoon after the whole Kingdom. The moſt important Affairs were not determin'd without her advice: And the King had quitted all ſorts of care for that of pleaſing her. But in this great Power, her main deſign was to marry her Daughter with the Prince: and the knowledge ſhe had of her Son in Law daily augmented in her the deſire of this union. <hi>Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalis</hi> ('twas the name of the Prince) was born ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily, and with ſo many advantages of Nature, that one of his leaſt qualities was to be Son to a King. He had a Beauty which gain'd the hearts of all that look'd upon it, a Wit which in the firſt years of his age found
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:62940:73"/>no equal, and a height of Soul and Courage which gave reſpect and fear to all the World. The Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of <hi>Alexander</hi> was not greater nor more marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous than his. There paſt no day wherein he did not ſay or do ſomething which aſtoniſh'd all the Court. Thoſe who had the art to judge of mens Fortunes by the lines of their Faces, ſpy'd promiſes of many great and incredible events in his. And thoſe who conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd his Actions and his great Qualities, ſaid the Crown of <hi>Aragon</hi> was too ſmall for a head like his. They foreſaw that the <hi>Moors,</hi> who were the Neighbours of his Father, ſhould one day be forc'd to put the Sea be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and them; and that no more time was neceſſary to give up <hi>Spain</hi> to one mans power, than was needful to give this young Prince ſtrength to draw his Sword. All theſe qualities daily augmented the Queens affection towards him, who knew him better than any. She wiſh'd with impatience an occaſion to effectuate the Marriage which ſhe had projected: and did not eſteem it ſo great an advantage for her Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be Queen of <hi>Aragon,</hi> as to be Wife to <hi>Alcidalis.</hi> But whatever we ſay of Fortune, it muſt be confeſs'd there's no prudence like hers. She eſtabliſhes her deſigns ſo far off, and guides them by ſuch ſecret paths, that 'tis impoſſible for our foreſight to hinder them; and in deſpite of our conduct ſhe arrives at the end of what ſhe enteprizes. She had reſolv'd to combat the Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of <hi>Roſalva:</hi> and ſee, ſhe brings from beyond the Seas an infant Maid, who, an Orphan and a Stranger, ſhall overthrow the deſigns of a moſt powerful and prudent Queen. The Prince of <hi>Tenarus,</hi> of one of the moſt Illuſtrious Families in the Kingdom of <hi>Calabria,</hi> and which had formerly given Kings to <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Sicily,</hi> had a great and important Succeſſion in <hi>Aragon,</hi> which he reſolv'd to go in perſon and poſſeſs himſelf of, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was diſputed him. But extreamly loving his
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:62940:74"/>Wife, and both of them having a great paſſion for an only Daughter about the age of ſix years, they could not reſolve to part, but paſs'd with all their Family to <hi>Aragon.</hi> They were receiv'd of the King and Queen with all the goodneſs and civility due to Strangers, and to Strangers of their quality and merit. But ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their arrival the Prince fell ſick, and in few days died; leaving his Wife in a deſpair, wherein 'twas not likely ſhe could live long. She receiv'd from the Queen, whoſe affection ſhe had gain'd, all the conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and aſſiſtance ſhe could wiſh, in her affliction, and in her Affairs. <hi>Roſalva</hi> had always found the Princeſs to her mind; but after her misfortune, pity did in ſuch a manner increaſe the affection ſhe bore her, that ſhe began to love her as her ſelf. She lodg'd her in the Palace, and had ſo much care of keeping her near her perſon, that it ſeem'd ſhe loſt ſomewhat when ever ſhe parted from her; and that ſhe was not at all her ſelf where <hi>Camilla</hi> was not: 'Twas ſo they call'd this affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted Princeſs. In the mean time, theſe extraordinary kindneſſes of the Queen, which perhaps were capable of curing any other malady but hers, wrought no other effect in her, than to ſweeten it a little, and to cauſe her bear her grief with leſs impatience and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair. And to ſay the truth, the death of the Prince her Husband in ſuch an ill conjuncture was ſo rude a ſhock, and ſo hard to ſupport, that all the goodneſs and conſolation of the Queen could not hinder her being arreſted, for want of nouriſhment and ſleep, by a ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which ſhe preſently judg'd would be the laſt of all her Evils. This extreamly griev'd the Queen, who paſſionately wiſh'd her health. She conjur'd the moſt expert Phyſicians to practiſe the greateſt ſecrets of their Art; but though at her ſolicitations they employ'd all their skill, and ſpar'd no diligence, the ſickneſs of the Princeſs prevail'd upon all their Remedies: Which
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:62940:74"/>ſhe well knew, and reſolv'd to follow the Prince her Husband with all the tranquillity which could be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by the only trouble ſhe had in death, of lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving her Daughter in her need, and leaving her an Orphan in an age ſo little capable of Reaſon; and in a ſtrange Countrey, where ſhe could not hope aſſiſtance, but from the goodneſs of the Queen. During theſe different thoughts which agitated her in the height of ſickneſs, the Queen, who viſited her as often as poſſible, having demanded how ſhe did, <hi>Camilla</hi> ſweetly turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her eyes upon her took her hand, which ſhe kiſs'd often without ſpeaking: then on a ſudden addreſſing her voice ſhe told her, That ſhe had infinite obligations to the beſt Queen in the World for the intereſt ſhe took in her health. That ſeeing ſhe did her the honour to enquire into the truth of her condition, ſhe would pleaſe to ſuffer her to ſay, ſhe felt her ſelf drawing near her end. But that the moſt mortal thought ſhe had in her preſent condition, was not that of her death; and that loving her daughter more than her life, ſhe had more regret to leave her than to leave the World. She pray'd her then to permit ſhe might ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage thoſe few hours that remain'd, and that ſhe might employ them in pouring into her boſom the laſt and moſt tender Sentiments of her Soul. Which were, That ſhe ſhould bleſs Heaven with all her heart, for bringing her into a condition to follow the Prince her Spouſe to his Grave, if before her death ſhe would daign to receive from her hand the Preſent ſhe was about to make of all, which in the World remain'd moſt dear and precious to her. That in all her miſeries ſhe could not believe Fortune was abſolutely her Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, ſeeing ſhe had given her the honour to be known to her; that, excepting the misfortune of her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, ſhe eſteem'd the Voyage of <hi>Aragon</hi> a happy one, though ſhe eaſily judg'd, 'twould coſt her life as well
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:62940:75"/>as his. However, ſhe thought ſhe had the good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of being belov'd by her at an eaſie rate; which ſhe ſo eſteem'd, that if the World had any thing ſhe loſt with impatience, 'twas her Friendſhip. But that ſhe comforted her ſelf with hopes, that her Daughter ſhould ſucceed in the honour of her Favours. That ſhe would have the goodneſs to be her Mother, and would do her the favour to have a care of her, as of a perſon ſhe be queath'd in dying. That ſhe pray'd her with all her heart to accept the Gift ſhe made: and that lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving her with this new quality of Daughter to the Queen, ſhe believ'd ſhe left her richer in it, than in the two Eſtates to which ſhe remain'd Heir. That ſhe ſhould die content, and believe her death would be in ſome ſort happy for <hi>Zelide,</hi> if it procur'd her the honour to be brought up by the wiſeſt Queen in the World. The Queen imbracing her ſaid, that ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd with much joy the Preſent ſhe made her, on condition ſhe would not revoke it: That from that moment ſhe would believe ſhe had two Daughters; and that there ſhould be no difference between them but this, that <hi>Zelide</hi> ſhould be always the eldeſt: but, that ſhe would take heart; and that ſhe hoped ſhe might live long yet, to be her ſelf a Witneſs of the effects of her Promiſe. This extreamly comforted the mind of <hi>Camilla,</hi> but did not diminiſh her diſeaſe. She liv'd two days longer, at the end whereof ſhe went out of the World with as much ſatisfaction, as men go out of Priſon; and left all the Court in ſadneſs, and the Queen in an affliction which cannot be repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Thus <hi>Zelide</hi> in leſs than three Months ſaw her Father and Mother interr'd in the Tomb of thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to whom they came to ſucceed. See her now at the Age of ſix years, three hundred Leagues from the place of her Birth, in a ſtrange Countrey, and, which is more to be fear'd by her, in the power of a perſon
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:62940:75"/>by whom the Stars threatned her with all the Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes of her life. But Fortune is the beſt Mother in the World: and no ill can happen to the Children which ſhe will adopt. She took this Orphan into her tute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage; and, by ſo unhappy beginnings, undertook to put two Crowns upon her head. <hi>Zelide</hi> was the moſt perfect piece that the Heavens ever made. As her life was to be full of Miracles, her perſon was ſo alſo: and this Hiſtory which is every where likely, is incredible only in what it recounts of her. Since the Sun made his courſe round this Globe, it had never ſeen a Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty more accompliſh'd than hers: and in the faireſt body in the World, ſhe had a mind which cannot be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd by ours: it ſeem'd to be of thoſe which are not to govern other Bodies than thoſe above, and which have been made to conduct the Stars. In an age where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in others ſcarce know how to pronounce words, ſhe ſaid things which would have been admir'd in the mouths of Sages. There was never known a Birth ſo happy as hers. All the Stars had conſpir'd to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow upon her what was beſt in them: and the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven had imparted ſo many of its excellencies, that the leaſt part of her was what ſhe held of the Earth; ſo that ſhe ſeem'd a Celeſtial perſon dropt down here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low by miracle. Her inclinations carried her ſo power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to good, that it ſeem'd ſhe had not free-will to do amiſs: and all the Vertues were ſo natural to her, that ſhe muſt have done violence to her ſelf not to exerciſe ſome one of them. There never was any combat in her Soul. She never was in doubt between good and evil: and ſhe always follow'd what was right and handſom in following all her will. Beſides ſo many perfections which were known, theſe hidden qualities and ſecret graces, which make us love a perſon with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out knowing why, were in her to ſuch a degree, that ſhe was always the inclination of all the World. There
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:62940:76"/>was I know not what charm in all her Actions, which ſhed love and delight in the hearts of all that beheld them: and the tone of her voice had ſomething which inchanted Souls. She had infinite other amiable qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, which cannot be expreſt: and the leaſt part of her perfections were thoſe which could be.</p>
            <q>See her, Madam, I think in every thing ſo like you, that there is no body but would take her for your Siſter. And for my part, though I extreamly well conſider'd her when you ſhew'd her to me, yet there were ſo many things to be obſerv'd, that I vow I could not paint her in my memory; and ſhould not have drawn her Picture ſo well, if I had not coppied her by you.</q>
            <p>With theſe Arms <hi>Zelide</hi> muſt conquer the Kingdom of <hi>Aragon:</hi> and there needed no other, ſeeing that for this purpoſe ſhe was only to gain the heart of <hi>Alcidalis,</hi> which all the force in the World could not vanquiſh.</p>
            <p>She was received into the Palace with ſuch a general joy and affection, that an augury might have been drawn from thence, that ſhe enter'd as Miſtreſs, and that ſhe ſhould one day Command there. The Queen, who thought ſhe could never have been comforted for the death of the Mother, could not be ſad as often as ſhe ſaw her: and the King ſcarce found a difference between the affection he bore her, and that which he had for his Son. <hi>Alcidalis</hi> and <hi>Zelide</hi> were in the age wherein we are wont to paint <hi>Cupids:</hi> and both of them with all the charms and all the graces, which the moſt excellent Painters know how to give them. They had a Beauty ſo equal, though extreamly different, and men ſaw Qualities ſhine in them ſo extraordinary, that there was no body but thought they were born one for the other. Each of them had been in the World
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:62940:76"/>without an equal, if they had not appear'd at the ſame time in it. So that, to ſay the truth, though they gain'd the affection of all that ſaw them, they had never been lov'd worthily, if they had not been lov'd by one another; and there were no other Souls but theirs, which were capable of ſo great a paſſion as each of them merited. <hi>Love,</hi> who reſolv'd to give ſignal proofs of his power in two ſuch rare perſons, eſtabliſh'd it betimes; ſo that they felt it a long time before they could know it; and would not let them paſs this firſt ſeaſon of their Age in quiet, which Nature ſeems to have freed from Paſſions. <hi>Zelide</hi> did not fail at firſt view to work the ſame effects in the heart of <hi>Alcidalis,</hi> which were ordinarily wrought by her in other men: and he alſo at the ſame time did cauſe in the breaſt of <hi>Zelide</hi> an emotion, which ſhe had never felt for any. The Queen, purſuing the deſign ſhe had projected, had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways brought up the Prince with thoſe Artifices which might induce him to love her Daughter: from the time that he could ſpeak, they were wont to call her his Miſtreſs: they carried him every day to viſit her: and all thoſe which were about him loſt no occaſion to praiſe her Beauty, or her Wit. But the inclinations of <hi>Alcidalis</hi> were not of accord with the Queens will. And he who had ſweetneſs and complacency for all the World, ſeem'd to want it only for the young Counteſs, and never appear'd ſo conſtrain'd as when he was with her. Whether it was that this glorious mind took it ill, that they ſhould deſtine him to any thing without informing themſelves of his will; or that the Stars, which had caus'd him to be born for <hi>Zelide,</hi> gave him a ſecret averſion for all thoſe who would uſurp her place. So that when ſhe was enter'd the Palace, and that the Queen had given her for Companion to her Daughter. His mind ſeem'd to be chang'd all at once. He never left the apartment of the Counteſs, nor en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:62940:77"/>good hours, but thoſe he paſt in <hi>Zelids</hi> company. Love, to be welcom'd into the Soul, makes its entrance accompanied with joy and beauty: and does no evil or violence till he thinks he is Maſter of the place, and that he hath render'd himſelf ſo powerful, that he need not fear to be chaced thence. At firſt theſe two young Lovers felt nothing in themſelves extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but an extream pleaſure to ſee each other. At their interviews they were touch'd with a certain joy and content, which they were not us'd to feel: and there was no body, but thought they imbelliſh'd each other as often as they met. <hi>Zelide,</hi> who till then had paſt a dull Childhood, began to be more awake than formerly. And <hi>Alcidalis</hi> was ſo gay and pleaſant when he ſaw her, that it ſeem'd he reſerv'd a peculiar humour and a grace to appear in before her. In this Innocent ſtate they were ſome Months peaceably enjoying this pleaſure; which was doubtleſs the moſt happy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition they knew for a long time after. But their minds from day to day taking new forces, their paſſion did ſo too. And Love began to be ſo powerful, that at laſt he made himſelf be felt, and render'd himſelf knowable. <hi>Alcidalis</hi> began to be more melancholy than formerly, and when he did not ſee <hi>Zelide,</hi> he paid for the content of having ſeen her by an extraordinary ſadneſs. There were no ſports nor paſtime for him, but thoſe he took with her; nor other pleaſure, but that of ſeeing her, and if any thing could touch him in her ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, 'twas to be ſpeaking of her. He, who in his Infancy propos'd to ſubject all the World, dreamt of nothing now but the conqueſt of <hi>Zelide:</hi> and if any thought of his firſt ambition returns, 'tis only with deſign to render him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf more worthy of her; and to lay at her feet as many Crowns as ſhe deſerv'd. As oft as he left her, he ſeem'd to have fallen from Heaven to Earth; and looſing her company, he could ſuffer nothing but ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:62940:77"/>And then he paſt exactly in his mind all her words and all her actions: and conſidering them by all their biaſſes, he drew conjectures favourable or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantagious. Then calling to mind all that he had ſaid or done, he ſtill repented him of ſomething. Sometimes he blam'd himſelf for being too fearful; another time for being too bold; and ſtill remain'd as ill ſatisfied with himſelf, as he was well ſatisfied with her. He began by little and little to leave all thoſe pleaſures which pleas'd him before. Hunting did not content him, if ſhe was not preſent: and if he had any care of his Exerciſes, 'twas only that he might appear more acceptable to her. In fine, he conſider'd <hi>Zelide</hi> as if ſhe had been alone in the World, and all his thoughts and deſigns began with her and ended with her. Love, on the other ſide, was well enter'd in the heart of <hi>Zelide;</hi> but had not made ſo great a progreſs, nor extended his power ſo far: whether ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with her fierceneſs, he durſt not make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf known to her; or whether ſhe being younger by two years, was leſs capable of this paſſion. However, ſhe felt ſome change in her ſelf as oft as ſhe ſaw the young Prince. She had more care of her Beauty and Dreſs than ordinary. She lov'd leſs the Counteſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe was deſtin'd for him: and the Duties which by force he render'd her, though 'twas with more coldneſs than formerly, did not fail to concern her. In the mean time, as ſhe had a Soul great, ſtrong and lively, and by conſequence capable of a paſſion which had all theſe qualities; the Merit of <hi>Alcidalis,</hi> and the Stars which inclin'd her, wrought with time an impreſſion there which nothing could ever efface, and form'd in it an affection as fair and perfect as her ſelf.</p>
            <p>Love, between perſons of High condition, is like a Fire upon a Tower, which cannot be hid, and which is ſeen afar off. The affection of <hi>Alcidalis</hi> and <hi>Zelide</hi>
               <pb n="152" facs="tcp:62940:78"/>was quickly known to all the World: and many had taken notice that they were amorous one of another, before they perceiv'd it themſelves. At firſt, when their Childhood render'd their Actions leſs conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, 'twas thought there was no other Love between them, but that of ſports and paſtimes, which they took together: But when with time <hi>Zelide</hi> became more ſerious, and that <hi>Alcidalis</hi> made appear in all his actions a Judgment which might ſerve to govern his Fathers Kingdom, there was no body in the Court but thought their two Souls were united by a veritable paſſion, and that 'twould be hard to ſeparate them. The Queen, who was very able, and to whom no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was ſo conſiderable as the young Prince, began betimes to ſuſpect the Graces of <hi>Zelide,</hi> and was one of the firſt who took notice of this affection. But truſting much to her Wit and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, ſhe thought ſhe could not be troubled with them, or find reliſtance in two young perſons over whom ſhe had a power; ſhe, who had bow'd the greateſt and ableſt men in the Kingdom. In the mean time, the Beauty of <hi>Zelide</hi> increaſed daily: and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as hitherto it had been as it were in its dawn, ſhe now advanc'd with ſo much light and ſplendour, that it ſeem'd ſhe declar'd openly againſt the Queen; as if in deſpite of her, ſhe would gain all the hearts in her Kingdom. On the other ſide, the young Prince, feeling his Birth and his Power, became weary of living under the Laws of Governours, and under the conduct of a Woman. His Breaſt, naturally great and Royal, was alſo ſwell'd up and inlarg'd with the paſſion which fill'd it, and could no longer acknowledge any other Empire than <hi>Zelides.</hi> He began openly to let appear the affection he had for her, and granted no Favours but by her recommendation. He wore only her Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours in Turnaments; and in Dances all his devices
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:62940:78"/>ſpake of her; and he could not endure it ſhould be imagin'd any, but ſhe had a part in his Soul. There was no body which did not in his heart favour this affection. Every body made ſecret Vows for them. Their paſſion was that of all the World; and their deſires were follow'd with the deſires of all others. The Queen now began to fear, and to perceive ſhe had too long defer'd to oppoſe ſo great a fire; that it would coſt her care to extinguiſh it; and that ſhe ſhould be forc'd to ſerve her ſelf of violent remedies. But ſhe would firſt try all others. She eſſay'd by all ways to regain the mind of <hi>Alcidalis,</hi> which ſhe ſaw was eſtrang'd from her. There was no artifice ſhe did not uſe to diminiſh the Beauty of <hi>Zelide,</hi> and to augment her Daughters. She inſtructed her in every thing ſhe was to ſay or do. She appear'd always with a great deal of Pomp; always dreſt, and hid in Jewels. But <hi>Zelide</hi> neglected, as ſhe was, ſhin'd more. Her eyes and colour took away the glittering from Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds, and whiteneſs from Pearls: and the Riches which Heaven had given her effac'd all thoſe of the Earth. The Queen therefore, obſerving how much her preſence was contrary to her deſigns, and that with one look ſhe overthrew all her Counſels; reſolv'd at laſt to ſeparate them, and to carry <hi>Zelide</hi> farther off: hoping that Abſence might blot out thoſe impreſſions which Love had ſtamp'd in their minds, as yet young and tender; and that thoſe ſhe had plac'd about <hi>Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalis</hi> to gain him, might find him more capable of being perſwaded, when he ſhould no longer ſee the object of this growing paſſion. She feign'd then, that for the health of her Daughter ſhe would go and paſs two or three Months at a Houſe ſhe had in <hi>Catalogua.</hi> And having communicated it to the King, ſhe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded every thing ſhould be made ready for her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, and ſaid, ſhe would not be accompanied by
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:62940:79"/>any but her Women. The aſtoniſhment of our Lovers, when they heard this news, is not a thing that can be repreſented. Hitherto they had not felt any of the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of Love, and had only had his Sweets and Roſes. They had quietly enjoy'd each others preſence: and except ſome apprehenſions for the future, which could not be ſtrong in minds ſo young and full of confidence, their Joy had been without trouble and without a cloud. <hi>Alcidalis</hi> was moſt ſenſibly touch'd with this diſpleaſure; or at leaſt he could worſt diſſemble it. There was not any thing which he did not attempt to break this deſign: and all things, even the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream, paſt through his imagination. But ſeeing that this Evil was without remedy; and that at laſt the time approach'd that <hi>Zelide</hi> muſt be carried from him: he reſolv'd at leaſt, not to let it paſs without openly declaring his affection, and letting her know of what quality it was. To this time he had liv'd with her without ſaying any thing of his Paſſion: and all his actions ſpake to her daily, though his words witneſs'd nothing of it. Whether it was, that ſhame, which is ordinary to this Age, had hinder'd him; or that being intirely fill'd and ſatisfy'd with the pleaſure of ſeeing her, he did not think of any thing elſe. In fine, the laſt Evening before her departure he went to the Queens Lodgings; where, after ſome time, he finds the way to meet <hi>Zelide</hi> apart. This was the firſt time that <hi>Alcidalis</hi> had felt what Fear was. Twice or thrice he try'd to ſay what he had reſolv'd upon: and having open'd his mouth he ſaid ſomething elſe, not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving reſolution enough for that. Whereas at other times, at the ſight of <hi>Zelide</hi> he was all fire, he felt himſelf now all Ice. But at laſt, after ſome indifferent diſcourſe, with a palpitation of heart, and a voice low and trembling he told her; I doubt not, <hi>Zelide,</hi> but you know I love you: but I am ſure you do not
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:62940:79"/>know how much. And becauſe this abſence of ſome days ought to be to me for ſo many years; and that I cannot tell whether I ſhall live ſo long: I will let you know my affection, to the end, that if you find me not at your return, you may know at leaſt how much you ought to pity me. If you conſider your ſelf, <hi>Zelide,</hi> and conſider me too; you will eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that you cannot breed ordinary affections; and you will believe of me, that I cannot receive mean ones; and if there is any thing extraordinary in my perſon, you muſt conclude 'tis chiefly this affection I bear you. By the knowledge you have of your ſelf and of me, you may imagine how ſincere it is, how faithful and how reſpectful; but how great it is you cannot know. That is a thing beyond all imagination: and I who feel it cannot expreſs it, and oftentimes I cannot comprehend it. From the moment I ſaw you, the paſſion I have for you was at a point to which after much time the greateſt are wont to arrive: and from that time there hath not paſt one moment in which it hath not receiv'd growth and augmentation. Whilſt I was a Child, I was not able to tell it you; and ſince, I durſt not. Even at this time I tremble in ſaying, I adore you: and if you do not re-aſſure me by a favourable regard, I ſhall not have force to finiſh what remains for me to ſay. Here ſhe, who had hitherto kept her eyes upon the ground, ſweetly caſt a glance upon him. It ſeem'd to <hi>Alcidalis,</hi> that he had ſeen the Heavens open'd in the eyes of <hi>Zelide,</hi> and taking courage he continued thus; It is true, <hi>Zelide,</hi> that I know the paſſion I have for you, is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and moſt perfect that ever was. But how do I know that it is permitted to Men to have a paſſion for you? I will tell you freely, Humility is a Vertue that you only have made me underſtand. I ever believed, that all the Earth was too little for me. But I now
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:62940:80"/>believe, that I my ſelf am too little for you: and as much as I eſteem all things below my ſelf, I hold my ſelf below your merits. I know well, that my Fortune is the laſt thing which you conſider in my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: and I am not To unhappy, but you may find in me ſome qualities, which you will eſteem more than that which my Birth has given me. But if there be any thing worthy of you, 'tis this Soul which I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to you; and which I can ſay is great enough, and noble enough to be receiv'd by yours. I would not praiſe it thus boldly, if it were ſtill mine: and I ſpeak advantagiouſly of it, as of all things that belong to you. Since it hath had any knowledge, it hath had but two deſigns: the firſt, and which entertain'd its Infancy, was the conqueſt of the World; and ſince it hath been more bold and more reaſonable, it hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd <hi>Zelide.</hi> If this adorable <hi>Zelide</hi> does not oppoſe me, 'twill be eaſie to bring about the other: and the Crown of <hi>Aragon,</hi> which I promiſe her now, and which all our Enemies cannot hinder me from giving her, ſhall be but a ſmall part of that which I will one day lay at her feet. <hi>Alcidalis</hi> was ſilent, expecting <hi>Zelides</hi> anſwer; who, in the trouble wherein ſhe was, had ſcarce ſtrength enough to pronounce theſe few words. Sir, I am ſo aſtoniſh'd to hear you ſpeak ſo ſeriouſly in a matter of this nature, and to ſee how every body conſiders our diſcourſe, that I know not what to ſay at preſent, and pray you permit me to defer the Anſwer till our return. In the mean time you may believe, I ſhall be glad they do not give me much time for it. During this diſcourſe, there was no body who did not faſten their eyes upon <hi>Alcidalis</hi> and <hi>Zelide,</hi> and who did not take notice, that he ſpake to her with more earneſtneſs than uſual. The Queen, who above all others had minded it, and to whom this converſe gave much diſquiet, roſe up, and approaching
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:62940:80"/>them ſaid pleaſantly to <hi>Alcidalis.</hi> Sir, you ſpeak to <hi>Zelide</hi> with ſo much action, and ſuch a ſerious coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, that it ſeems you have ſome quarrel with her. If it be ſo, complain to me. For I will be on your ſide; and before ſhe parts, ſhe ſhall do you right. <hi>Alcidalis</hi> having born the firſt brunt, and taken the boldneſs to ſpeak of his affection to <hi>Zelide,</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident enough; and being deſirous to continue the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, was in deſpair ſeeing it interrupted: and, ſcarce looking upon the Queen, anſwer'd fiercely; Madam, I hold <hi>Zelide</hi> for ſo juſt a perſon, that if ſhe had done me wrong, I would have no other Judge but her ſelf. There is no occaſion, that any ſhould mingle themſelves in our differences: and whatever quarrel we have, I cannot be pleas'd with thoſe that think it their duty to part us. Every body took notice of this Anſwer; and the Queen, who was moſt ſenſible of it, ſeem'd leaſt to underſtand it, and preſently chang'd the diſcourſe. In the Morning <hi>Zelide</hi> departed, and left the Prince in a mortal heavineſs; but ſhe was in this more unhappy than he; for beſides that ſhe felt the like, ſhe had moreover the pain of concealing it, and to be obliged to laugh before the World, when her Soul wept tears of blood.</p>
            <p>Amongſt all the diſpleaſures which Love draws a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with it, Abſence is one of the moſt ſenſible. There are ſome ſharp griefs, as Jealouſie, which pierce and wound more: but there is none ſo weighty and ſo hard to ſupport, and which overwhelms all ſort of vigour as this. The firſt thing which <hi>Alcidalis</hi> did was to retire alone to his Chamber: there he caſt himſelf upon his Bed, and melting into Tears aad Sighs, ſuffer'd the ſame regrets as if <hi>Zelide</hi> had been dead, and not abſent. Why do you complain, <hi>Alcidalis?</hi> you have all your life peaceably enjoy'd the fight of <hi>Zelide,</hi> and do you not know how to endure a few days abſence? Love is
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:62940:81"/>wont to lend all his Joys at groſs uſury. He makes his Subjects pay for all at laſt. And it is not his ordinary courſe to leave thoſe that owe him any thing ſo long at repoſe. You are one of thoſe he hath treated moſt favourably. Reſerve then theſe Tears to another oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, wherein they ſhall be better employ'd. The time will ſhortly come when you ſhall have more reaſon to lament: and the day approaches that <hi>Zelide</hi> and you ſhall be more cruelly parted, without hopes of ever meeting again. He paſs'd all that day without ſeeing any body, and the following without ſpeaking, except when he went to ſee the King, and could not avoid to anſwer him. At laſt, having paſt eight days in all the ſadneſs and impatience imaginable: he thought he was at the end of his life, and that it was a thouſand years ſince he had ſeen <hi>Zelide.</hi> So that one Evening being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone in his Chamber to entertain his thoughts; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out taking Counſel of any, but his deſires and inquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, he reſolv'd to go where <hi>Zelide</hi> was. And ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that in this abſence he foreſaw an infallible death, he concluded there could not worſe happen to him from his attempting to ſee her.</p>
            <p>After that the <hi>Heber,</hi> which is one of the moſt cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated Rivers of <hi>Spain,</hi> hath paſs'd along the Walls of <hi>Saragoſa:</hi> as if there were nothing more worthy of him in <hi>Aragon,</hi> he takes the way of <hi>Catalogna;</hi> where having receiv'd in his paſſage many ſmall Rivolets to enter more magnificently into the Sea, at laſt he ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders himſelf to it half a League from <hi>Tortoſa.</hi> All the ground which he waters is extreamly fertile, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd with Trees; and by ſo much the more pleaſant as the reſt of the Countrey conſiſts in dry and naked Plains, or in Mountains black and ſcorch'd with a fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Sun. Fifteen Leagues from its mouth, it paſſes by a Valley of two Leagues in length, and two in breadth; and which is incompaſs'd on one ſide and on
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:62940:81"/>the other with Mountains. In this place the River glides very peaceably by the incounter of certain Rocks, which four Leagues further oppoſe its courſe, and makes many doublings in the Plain, as doubtful of the way it ought to take through thoſe Mountains. Its Banks are extreamly ſhady and flowry. And its Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſo clear and neat, that there is not a Tree near it, nor ſcarce a Flower which is not ſeen twice; and which does not appear in the Water as fair and diſtinct, as upon the ground. The ordinary Plants of this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey are <hi>Oaks, Olives,</hi> and <hi>Pines:</hi> and beſides that it is not cold, there are none of theſe Trees that fear it. The Mountains of <hi>Catalogna</hi> defend the Valley from the North-wind, ſo that at all times 'tis cover'd with green; and the Winter, which they always ſee on the Neighbour Mountains, is not felt there. 'Twas in this Paradiſe that <hi>Zelide</hi> made her Hell, and where the Houſe to which the Queen had carried her ſtood. One would have ſaid, that the River, Flowers, and Plants were imbelliſh'd by her preſence. She only was ſad amidſt ſo many objects of Pleaſure, and loſt daily that luſtre and beauty, which ſhe ſeem'd to impart to all things. The abſence of <hi>Alcidalis</hi> afflicted her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly. But above all, the deſigns of the Queen caſt her into perplexities: and her imagination ſo well repreſented to her all thoſe Evils which were to befal her; that often the fear of what was to come, took from her the feeling of the preſent. She ſaw that her Goods, her Fortune, and her ſelf were in the power of the Queen; and, that which ſhe dreaded moſt, that <hi>Alcidalis</hi> was ſo too: he that was more dear to her than her ſelf, than her Goods, or than her Fortunes. She conſider'd that the Princes Affection was not ordinary, that his Courage was extraordinary; but that his power was as yet but weak. That he would never be ſuffer'd to deſpiſe the City of <hi>Barcelona,</hi> which For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:62940:82"/>offer'd him ſo happily with the Queens Daughter; to take an Orphan and a Stranger who had no Riches, Friends, or ſupport, but beyond the Seas. That he alone could not reſiſt the King and Kingdom. That the Queen abſolutely govern'd both. That whilſt they were Children, all men lik'd their affection, but that no body would approve of their Marriage. And, that ſome already look'd upon it as the Enemy of the State, and the Torch which ſhould one day fire the Royal Houſe. Theſe thoughts, and others like them, fill'd her mind with a thouſand Troubles. And as far as ſhe carried her ſight into ſuturities, ſhe ſaw no day for her Hopes: and without knowing, in this Labyrinth, what end her Adventures might take, ſhe eaſily judg'd it could not be a happy one. One day amongſt the reſt, accompanying the Queen, who walk'd in a Wood ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly ſhaded, whoſe Alleys led to the Meadow, which ſerv'd as a border to the River, ſhe ſound op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to leave the Company, follow'd only by one of her Maids. And it was not a ſmall conſolation to her, that ſhe ſound her ſelf at liberty to be ſad, and to appear ſo. Repreſenting to her ſelf the Fortunes of her life; running over the paſt Misfortunes, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and thoſe which threatned her; her thoughts had entertain'd her ſo well, that not thinking of the way ſhe had made, ſhe found her ſelf upon the Banks of <hi>Heber,</hi> and in a place ſo pleaſant as might have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted any other Grief, but hers. The Sun, which in this Countrey lies down in the Ocean, and appears fairer than in any place of the World; was now ready to hide it ſelf in thoſe clouds of Gold and Azure, wherewith 'tis invelop'd when it goes to viſit the Nymphs of the Sea. But having ſeen nothing from its riſing ſo fair as <hi>Zelide;</hi> it ſeemed, that to behold her longer, he made no haſte to deſcend into the Floods: and caſt ſo much Gold upon all the Leaves of the
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:62940:82"/>Trees, and Waves of the River, that he ſeem'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindle his Rays to continue a day in favour of this Princeſs; invironing her in ſuch a manner, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording ſo well with the reſt of her Beauties, that it was doubtful whether thoſe Rays were the <hi>Suns</hi> or <hi>Zelides.</hi> The charms of this delicious place the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Air, and the pleaſure ſhe took in being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, intic'd her to continue her walk in the Meadow. After ſome time, taking the Path that led to the Queen, the ſound of a Horn, which ſeemed not to come far off, made her turn her head toward the neighbouring Mountain; where, having arreſted her ſight, ſhe ſaw as ſhe thought, two men ſtrugling toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who roll'd down from the height of a Rock: But afterwards ſhe perceiv'd that what ſhe took for two men, was a man and a Bear which wreſtled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; but with that diſadvantage, which we may imagine in a combat ſo unequal. At the ſame time ſhe ſaw, near that part of the Mountain from whence they fell, a young Cavalier advantagiouſly mounted, carrying a Horn hanging in a Ribband, and a Lance in his hand. Who ſtopping a little, and ſeeing the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in which the man was, who ſeem'd to be of his company; put on his Horſe, or, to ſay better, preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitated him to the bottom of the Mountain. But ſuch was the ſtrength of the Horſe, the skill of the Cavalier, or the fortune of both, that, as if he had run in a plain field, without receiving any hurt, he found himſelf near the Bear, and thruſt the Lance he had in his hand ſo far into his entrails, that at the ſame time he loſt his life and his prey: All this too, to thunder down the Mountain, kill the Bear, and deliver his Friend, was done ſo in an inſtant, that one might ſay, Lightning does not fall more ſwift, nor more readily work its effects. It diſpleaſed <hi>Zelide,</hi> that any but <hi>Alcidalis</hi> had given this blow: and ſhe was vext to have ſeen in
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:62940:83"/>any other but him ſomething that might pleaſe her. But the Cavalier making towards her, and wading over the River, ſhe began to doubt if it was not he: and as he drew nearer, having finiſh'd to know him, but not daring to remain certain, ſhe turn'd back to her Maid and ask'd her, if ſhe knew that Cavalier. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, replies ſhe, when he was further off, we ought to have known him by what he did, but now we ſee that it is the Prince. He was now twenty paces from them. Wonder, fear and joy, at once ſeiz'd upon <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lide;</hi> ſo that ſhe could not find words for the firſt Complements. The Prince, who was prepar'd for this encounter, though with much difficulty on his ſide, was more aſſur'd than ſhe; and ſaid to her, If I had not known, Madam, that this was the place where you were, by the Pleaſures of it 'twas eaſie to divine, that <hi>Zelide</hi> was not far off. None but you could cauſe the birth of ſo many Flowers in ſo deſert a Soil, or could have wrought this Miracle in the Mountains of <hi>Catalogna.</hi> Sir, ſays <hi>Zelide</hi> to him, who now had leaſure ro recollect her Spirits, you are ingrateful to the <hi>Heber,</hi> on whoſe Banks you are, and which ſeem'd to ſtoop under you to favour your paſſage over, to give me a glory which is due to the fertility of its Waves: which water and imbrace this Valley with ſo much care, that when you ſhall have well conſider'd the beauty of this Meadow, theſe Woods and this Park which we are entring, you may confeſs, that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces of <hi>Saragoſa,</hi> and the Magnificences of the <hi>Mooriſh</hi> Kings, may be left for this ſolitude. But, after all this, I aſſure you Sir, ſaith ſhe ſmiling, we have ſeen nothing in this Valley ſo handſom, as what you ſhew'd upon the Mountain. And I, ſays the Prince, who was minded to change this diſcourſe, that when from the Mountain we had the proſpect of all about us, nothing appear'd ſo fair, as what you let us ſee in this
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:62940:83"/>Valley. Now they had taken the path which led to the Queen, and the Maid that follow'd them, ſtaying a little behind, <hi>Zelide</hi> with a low voice ſaid to him; Sir, you have perform'd two things of a great deal of boldneſs; one, to precipitate your ſelf from the Rock to combat ſuch a ſavage Animal; the other, to give the Queen a viſit in a time ſhe ſo little expected it. Madam, anſwer'd <hi>Alcidalis,</hi> it had been a greater boldneſs for me to have ſtaid in <hi>Saragoſa.</hi> For that had been with a firm foot to attend that death I could not ſhun, if I had remain'd longer without ſeeing you. So that what ſeems to you a raſhneſs, is rather want of Courage: ſeeing I am come hither to avoid a greater peril, than either of thoſe you ſay I have engag'd in. I could not have imagin'd that, ſays ſhe to him. And for my part, I vow to you, I durſt not have fought the Bear, and I durſt as little have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleas'd the Queen. But I think I have courage e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to ſuffer an Abſence. To know what an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence is, replies <hi>Alcidalis,</hi> we muſt know what affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is: and you cannot ſuffer here, you Madam, who ought to love none but your ſelf; and who carry al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways with you whatever is amiable in the World. <hi>Alcidalis,</hi> anſwer'd <hi>Zelide,</hi> you do not believe what you ſay: and if you thought me ſo ungrateful and ſo vain as not to love any but my ſelf, you would not have ſo much impatience to ſee me. But to the end that you may be better inform'd, give me the hearing and leaſure to make that anſwer I promis'd you at our parting. And becauſe in ſaying this, ſhe felt ſhe bluſh'd extreamly, and ſaw that he took notice of it, ſhe began thus; The colour which mounts up to my Cheeks, proceeds rather from my being about to ſpeak ſomething which I am not wont to ſpeak, than from an apprehenſion of doing any thing in it contrary to my duty. I know not, if it be always a ſhame for a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:62940:84"/>to confeſs ſhe Loves; but I know, if any may be excus'd, 'tis I more than another. I will not ſay, that the Stars have done me violence, or that your qualities have obliged me to it: 'tis a cloak and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence under which all others may ſhrow'd themſelves. I will only alledge what is particular for my defence. Before I knew that 'twas not lawful to love, I knew you to be amiable: and I received your affection in a time, when I did not know thoſe Laws which forbid our Sex to entertain any. I cannot be blam'd for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulging a paſſion, which I may ſay, I found in my Soul rather than let it in; and which hath been ſo long its Gueſt, that I can no more remember its birth than my own. The firſt Sentiment I had in the World was, that which concern'd me for you: and Self-love, which we feel betimes, and which is ſo natural to all the World, enter'd my mind later than that Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip I bear you. My Reaſon, which appear'd long after, found it ſo well eſtabliſh'd, that it took it for a part of my ſelf: Beſides, it ſeem'd ſo innocent and ſo juſt, that ſhe hath rather ſtrove to fortifie, than to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy it. I ſay all this, to excuſe me with you and with my ſelf; and to let you ſee, that a mind the moſt ſtrong and moſt juſt in the World, had been taken as mine. If you are glad then, that I love you, do not thank me for it; but thank the gods that will'd it. And if you are oblig'd to me in any thing, 'tis for that I have been willing to confeſs it. For if I had not ſtrength enough to extinguiſh the affection I bore you, I had enough to hide it: and it was in my power to diſſemble it all my life; or as ſome do, to drop out a confeſſion after you had long attended it. But if it be unreaſonable and unworthy of you and me, it would never be time to diſcover it: and if on the contrary, 'tis ſuch as I ought to have to be worthy of <hi>Alcidalis</hi> and <hi>Zelide;</hi> why ſhould I not give you now
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:62940:84"/>the content of knowing and being aſſur'd of it? I tell you then <hi>Alcidalis,</hi> I love you; and though I ſpeak it with a bluſh, yet I ſpeak it without ſhame; I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of that heart which you ſay you give me. For what concerns the Crown you promiſe me with it, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune ſhall diſpoſe thereof. I eſteem more what you have given me, than any thing ſhe can offer; and I prize your heart more than your Kingdom. I am glad to ſee there is not a quality in you which is not Royal. But I wiſh your Birth were not. This Crown which you promiſe me as the Crown of my ſelicity, will be the cauſe of all my misfortune: and to get from me that which I leaſt eſteem in you, they will uſe all ways to raviſh from me the reſt. I ſee, at this hour, but with an aſſured Brow, all the evils that threaten me. I know your Love will procure me all mens hatred; and becauſe you wiſh me well, I ſhall ſuffer much ill. But ſhe, who with the heart of <hi>Zelide</hi> has alſo that of <hi>Alcidalis,</hi> ought to fear nothing. I will reſiſt all with a reſolution ſhall aſtoniſh you: and ſeeing the Heavens will have me bear an affection; I will accompany it with ſo much Conſtancy, Courage, and Vertue, that what is ordinarily blam'd in our Sex, ſhall be in me a ſubject of eſteem and praiſe. <hi>Alcidalis,</hi> who at the beginning was dead with fear, as a man who was to hear the Sentence of his life or death; perceiving after what manner ſhe ſpake, and that it was much more favourable than he durſt wiſh, could ſcarce believe his ears. But at laſt, ſeeing he was not deceiv'd, he found himſelf in ſuch a raviſhment, that he was a long time without ſaying any thing, and could not find words to thank her. Indeed, there were none to be found; and his ſeeking for them was an effect of the preſent perplexity. He anſwer'd better by Silence and tears of Joy. But having turn'd into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Alley, and ſeeing himſelf out of the ſight of her
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:62940:85"/>which followed them, he put one knee to the ground, and as he began to ſpeak, he ſpied the Queen at the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end; who knowing of <hi>Alcidalis</hi> arrival came to receive him. The Alley was not ſo long, but what was done in it might be ſeen diſtinctly from one end to the other. <hi>Alcidalis</hi> roſe up as ſpeedily as he could. and <hi>Zelide,</hi> extreamly troubled at this encounter, told him, Sir, your undue humility will coſt you dear, and ſee a beginning of my Propheſies. Madam, anſwer'd <hi>Alcidalis,</hi> I can fear nothing ſeeing you are for me: and we ſhall be too ſtrong for all the reſt of the World, ſo long as we are of a ſide. Therefore, replies ſhe, they will ſoon find ways to part us. They ſaid all this with an action wherewith we ſpeak things indifferent, ſtill having an eye upon the Troop which came towards them. The Queen was now advanc'd, and <hi>Alcidalis</hi> being near her, ſhe receiv'd him with a face ſo open and pleaſant, that <hi>Zelide</hi> could not have done more. When the firſt Complements were finiſh'd, and that the Prince had told her, his Sport having led him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſix or ſeven Leagues off the houſe, he believ'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf bound to come and kiſs her hands; the Queen ſaid, ſhe was beholding to Fortune for conducting him thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But Sir, ſays ſhe, I believe you are well paid for the trouble. For 'tis to be imagin'd, that the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour <hi>Zelide</hi> hath granted you is not ordinary, ſeeing you were oblig'd to thank her on your knee. And truly at firſt I could not know you, but thought it was one of your Servants. However, I am glad no other than your ſelf receiv'd this ſatisfaction. Tell us, I pray, what is the matter, and what ſhe hath promis'd or given you, that I may ſhare in it, or joyn with you to thank her. <hi>Zelide</hi> did not bluſh, for, from the time ſhe began her diſcourſe with <hi>Alcidalis,</hi> ſhe had not put off that Colour. And fearing he could not come off in this diſcourſe; as indeed Womens wits are more
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:62940:85"/>at hand, and ſerve a ſurprize beſt; ſhe advanc'd to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for him, and ſaid, Madam, I ask'd <hi>Alcidalis</hi> news of <hi>Saragoſa,</hi> he who doubtleſs thought of his Hunting did not reply; I reproaching his heedleſsneſs and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, he put his knee to the ground to ſatisfie me; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving by an irregular and immeaſurable civility to repair the ſmall care he had of anſwering me. That is to be very civil, ſays the Queen coldly. And becauſe you think the Prince dreams ſtill, you ſtep up to anſwer for him. <hi>Zelide</hi> began to faulter, ſeeing the Queen preſs upon her in this manner, and believ'd, ſhe would not be able to ſuppreſs the evil-will ſhe bore her, but that now 'twould break out before all the World. But <hi>Alcidalis</hi> perceiving her perplexity came in to her ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour, as ſhe had done to his, and broke off the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with that of his Hunting. He was ſo poſſeſt with Joy for what <hi>Zelide</hi> had ſaid, that he entertain'd the Queen all that day with a marvellous complacency, and was more careful to diſcourſe with her Daughter than ever before. But theſe two young perſons were not crafty enough to deceive her. She ſoon took no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of this change. By the pleaſantneſs of <hi>Alcidalis,</hi> and the extraordinary aſſiduities which he render'd to her Daughter, ſhe thought he muſt be well content and aſſur'd of <hi>Zelide.</hi> She ſaw by this, that there was no time to loſe, and from that day took up the reſolution, which afterwards coſt our Lovers ſo many tears and dangers. Prepare your ſelf <hi>Alcidalis</hi> for the misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes which threaten you: and take the contentment you have this day receiv'd, as the laſt kindneſs of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. Expect no more Friendſhip from her, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent your ſelf with that of <hi>Zelide.</hi> The next day the Prince went for <hi>Saragoſa,</hi> and the Queen eight days after. <hi>Alcidalis</hi> ſuffer'd this Abſence with more pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence than the former; his thoughts being now ſo ſweet and ſatisfactory, that with them he could not but be
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:62940:86"/>happy. But as a fair day is always more fair than the faireſt night, and as there is no perfect contentment in darkneſs: it ſeem'd, that the preſence of <hi>Zelide</hi> brought a new Joy to his Soul, and gave new force to thoſe pleaſures which without her he could not intirely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh. He paſs'd ſome Months with an extream con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and ſo perfect a one, that from thence only 'twas eaſie to gueſs it could not laſt, and that this great calm would be follow'd by a violent tempeſt. The ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and aſſurance which he had, made him live with more diſcretion than formerly, and with more fear of diſpleaſing the Queen. He ſerv'd her Daughter with more care, and entertain'd <hi>Zelide</hi> but ſeldom, and contented himſelf with the liberty of ſeeing her. She alſo, who was ſerious from her Infancy, began to be more ſo; to ſpeak to the Prince with more reſpect; to give him fewer occaſions of approaching her, and to ſear more, leſt they ſhould imagine any thing of her affection. But this diſcretion, as for the moſt part that of Lovers, came too late. The Queen would not be abus'd by it: and with much care, ſecrecy and diligence took order for the execution of thoſe deſigns ſhe had projected. As thoſe who are in a Cittadel which is ſecretly undermin'd, have ordinarily more fear of any other peril than that which threatens them, and are quiet whilſt their Grave is digging, and whilſt that ruine is preparing that muſt in a moment overwhelm them: ſo theſe two Lovers ſuſpected nothing of the Treaſon which was hatching againſt them, but were in a profound tranquillity; and if the ill-will of the Queen made them apprehend ſome misfortune, they did not imagine it ſo great, ſo preſent, nor of ſuch a nature as that which was to happen to them. Here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin thoſe Misfortunes which ſeem to be endleſs; and adventures ſo ſtrange and involv'd, that if it be ſcarce credible that they did really happen, it is no leſs hard
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:62940:86"/>to believe, that they could be invented, or be the effects of the ſtrongeſt imagination.</p>
            <p>It ſeem'd to Fortune, that <hi>Aragon</hi> and <hi>Catalogna</hi> were too narrow Theaters, to repreſent the faireſt piece ſhe had ever acted in the World: ſhe would take one more ſpacious; and changing the face of that we have hitherto ſeen, inſtead of <hi>Saragoſa</hi> and <hi>Barcelona,</hi> Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows and Walks; ſhe will let us ſee the Sea and <hi>Africa,</hi> perſons unknown, people ſcarce heard of, Ships taken and burnt, Duels and Battels. And what is more ſtrange, at the ſame time and in the ſame Subject, Chains and Crowns.</p>
            <p>Four Months after the Queen had left <hi>Catalogna,</hi> ſhe took occaſion to return; but did not declare her mind till the day before. <hi>Alcidalis</hi> and <hi>Zelide</hi> were ſo ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd, that they had ſcarce leaſure to bid adieu. But when the Prince declar'd his grief for her departure, ſhe told him, Sir remember what you ſaid in <hi>Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logna,</hi> That there was nothing in the World you could ſear ſo long as I was of your ſide. We have other manner of Evils to ſuffer. But in all your misfortunes remember, that you cannot be unhappy, being aſſur'd I love you. You cannot doubt of that, ſeeing I ſay it. If that be not enough receive this Ring, which in the preſence of the Gods I give you together with my heart. <hi>Alcidalis</hi> took it, and having given her another with the ſame words, they parted. The Queen the next day pretended ſhe had receiv'd News from <hi>Barcelona,</hi> which oblig'd her to go thither; ſo ſhe left her Daughter with part of her Train, and carried <hi>Zelide</hi> along with her. They came to that fair City, which no leſs for its ſcituation, than for the fertility of its Territory, is one of the moſt famous in <hi>Spain. Zelide</hi> wonder'd, that the Queen having left her Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, did not leave her too. And having well conſider'd the Novelty, ſhe judg'd it was not done without ſome
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:62940:87"/>reaſon. But on what ſide ſoever ſhe caſt her eye, ſhe could not imagine any thing; and ſeeing nothing which ſhe could particularly fear, ſhe fear'd every thing. The Queen having imploy'd the reſt of that day in behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Magnificences of her reception, gave the next to thoſe affairs which 'twas thought led her thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>The day after 'twas told her, a Ship which bore her Name enter'd the Port. She ſaid, ſhe would preſently go and ſee it. In their way they beheld all that pomp of the Sea, which is ſo pleaſant to ſee when we are on the Shore. But nothing could be a divertiſement to <hi>Zelide;</hi> her heart told her, that the Evils ſhe had fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen began to tread upon her heels, and on all ſides ſhe fear'd Ambuſhes. The Queen put her ſelf into a Boat, and bid <hi>Zelide</hi> follow her. She found the Captain a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board and his Wife, and after ſhe had taken a view of the Veſſel, ſhe ſhut her ſelf up with them in the Cabin. This augmented the Suſpicions of <hi>Zelide:</hi> and with tears in her eyes ſhe caſt a look upon the Land, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to doubt, if ſhe ſhould ever return thither. An hour after the Captain and his Wife came out and told <hi>Zelide,</hi> the Queen call'd for her. All her Blood at this inſtant froze in her Veins. The Queen bid her ſhut the door, and thus deliver'd her ſelf.</p>
            <p>'Tis long ſince, <hi>Zelide,</hi> that we loſt together, you the beſt Mother in the World, and I the beſt Friend. The affection I had for her will never be loſt in me, nor the memory of her laſt words, wherewith ſhe pray'd me to have a care of you. If this conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had not ingag'd me, yet your Beauty, Parts and Virtue would have oblig'd me to it. And having nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh'd you thus long, and found in you with advantage all thoſe qualities which endear'd her to me, I ſhould not be reaſonable, if I had not a kindneſs for you too. And I may ſay, that in this I have done more than
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:62940:87"/>ſhe deſir'd. She pray'd me to love you as her Daughter, and I have always lov'd you as mine. She, whom the Heavens only gave me in the World, loſt the name of only, from the day I took charge of you. I have had the ſame affection, and the ſame tenderneſs for you, as for her: and I have conſider'd the one and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as if you were equally mine. It being ſo, and not one of your actions, or any thing that concern'd you having been indifferent to me, you may believe it hard, that I ſhould not have ſome knowledge of that paſſion which your Beauty, without your conſent, hath bred in the mind of <hi>Alcidalis;</hi> and that, as well as you, I have been often troubled about the wrong it might do you. You know what truſt is to be given to perſons of his age and condition, who have equally the priviledge to deceive and to deny. And I make you Judge, if it be poſſible the affection he hath for you can ever be advantagious to you. You ſee, as well as I, all the reaſons that will not permit it. You are too wiſe ever to have hop'd it: and though it ſhould be in his power and yours, you are Juſt enough, and grateful enough not to deſire it. I know your Vertue, <hi>Zelide;</hi> and I know there is nothing in the World which can endanger it. But, as great as it is, you cannot take from the Prince occaſions of viſiting you, nor from others of ſpeaking of you. All that your Vertue can do in this is to hinder the evil, but it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hinder the fame: and I know of what prejudice this report is to perſons of your Sex; and particularly, what diſpleaſure it cauſes to perſons of your wiſdom and honour. I thought therefore, 'twas my part to come in to your aſſiſtance: and that 'twas time to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Promiſes I made your Mother. The Duke of <hi>Tarant</hi> is a Prince wiſe and vertuous; conſiderable in <hi>Italy,</hi> and eſteem'd of all his Neighbours: He, by his Letters and Meſſengers, hath long ſince declar'd to
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:62940:88"/>me a great paſſion for you: I would not tell you of it till the matter was certain and fully ripe. This day I underſtand he expects you, <hi>Zelide,</hi> to give you poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his Eſtate and Perſon. He that Commands this Veſſel left him but fifteen days ſince, and promis'd him, on my part, to carry you thither in as many more. Diligence and Secreſie, for reaſons I cannot now ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint you with, are ſo important, that 'tis needful you depart this minute. I doubt not but your good nature will cauſe in you ſome regret to leave us. But though we are ſeparated by the Sea, our affections ſhall not be leſs united. In fine, you ought to be glad of returning into a Countrey, where you will find your Eſtate, your Kindred, and the place of your Birth. But though this ſhould not be your will, 'tis enough to let you know that 'tis mine. Beſides the power that my quality gives me over you, I have that of a Mother which lends me more authority. Conſent then, and willingly agree to a thing, which beſides that it is juſt, is alſo neceſſary: and by a ready obedience to what I counſel and command you at once, make appear that modeſty you owe to your ſelf, and that reſpect you owe to me. This you may eaſily reſolve to do, for he you think ſo faithful to you, and who ought moſt to oppoſe it, is the firſt that conſented to it. With theſe words ſhe imbrac'd her; and pretending ſhe would not take a long adue for fear of afflicting her too much, left the Cabin.</p>
            <p>Grief, deſpite, ſhame, rage and the exceſs of the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, did ſo oppreſs the Spirits of <hi>Zelide,</hi> that not being able to ſpeak a word or ſtir a foot, ſhe remain'd in the condition wherein the Queen left her: and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, 'twas the beſt wherein ſhe found her ſelf for a long time after, ſeeing that at this firſt brunt ſhe felt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. All our powers are ſo weak and ſo limited, that we are not capable of any thing extraordinary: and,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:62940:88"/>as a great light blinds us, and a great noiſe deaſens us; great Griefs are not felt, no more than great Joys are. She had remain'd thus without motion a quarter of an hour: when at laſt her Spirits, buried under this ſudden ruine of all things, beginning to return, ſhe thought there would be no remedy to this evil, if ſhe did not find one in this inſtant; ſo ſhe runs out of the Cabin, intending to caſt her ſelf at the Queens feet, and to try if ſhe could change her mind. But when they told her ſhe was gone, and that ſhe ſaw they were got out to Sea, ſhe caſt her eyes upon the ſhore, and her thoughts upon what ſhe had left there, and on a ſudden took up a reſolution which ſeem'd to quiet her. Then, with a ſerene countenance, turning towards thoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout her, ſhe ſpake ſome few words, and ſeeming to receive the Conſolations they tender'd, ſhe went to her Bed, and pray'd them to leave her to her reſt. Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <hi>Alcidalis,</hi> thou art now counting the moments as they paſs: and when thou thinkeſt of the eight days in which thou ſhalt not ſee <hi>Zelide,</hi> this term appears infinite. Whilſt ſhe is remov'd from thee for many years. In a few days the Sea ſhall be between thee and her. The Wind hurries away all thy Joys and all thy Hopes; and is about to put into the power of another the only good thou deſireſt in the World, and the only one that is worthy of thee in it. Fear and Hope are the two Winds of our Soul, which never ceaſe, and there are no Tempeſts in it which are not made by one of them. The preſent, being only a point, would not be conſiderable to us, if one of theſe two paſſions did not make us feel the future. <hi>Zelide</hi> believ'd, that For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune had put her in a condition, wherein it was not in her power to hurt or ſuccour her. So that ſhe was in that fatal tranquillity in which thoſe are who neither fear nor hope, and who only expect the end of their miſeries in the end of their life. And amidſt ſo many
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:62940:89"/>miſeries, at leaſt ſhe had not that of ſeeking remedies, which is one of the greateſt torments to wretched per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. Being well reſolv'd of what ſhe had to do; and knowing, within a little, how long her Misfortunes could laſt, ſhe paſt the night in thinking of <hi>Alcidalis,</hi> and flatter'd her ſelf with ſome content, when ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fider'd that ſignal proof ſhe was about to give him of her affection and courage. Though the Queens laſt words, whereby ſhe would have made her believe, that the Prince betray'd her, caus'd in her ſome violent tranſports.</p>
            <p>When the Captain and his Wife thought ſhe was awake, they enter'd the Cabin, and asking her, if ſhe would not eat; ſhe reply'd, that not only ſhe would not eat now, but that ſhe would eat no more. They were ſtartled at the Anſwer, and thought ſhe was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laps'd to her firſt ſadneſs, and that it requir'd more time to digeſt it. But, ſome hours after, ſeeing ſhe did not call, they return'd and us'd all Arguments to perſwade her to eat: To all which ſhe did not anſwer, but by an obſtinate ſilence, and by ſo cold and reſolv'd a look, that ſhe did not ſeem to hear them. They went out the ſecond time extraordinarily troubled, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to fear ſome tragick end of this ſtrange reſolution. At night they return'd, and with a Neece they had of the age of <hi>Zelide</hi> they kneel'd about the Bed, conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring her by all things, to have a care of her life. They could not for all this obtain an Anſwer, but withdrew at laſt, that they might not rob her of her repoſe, which ſeem'd to be the only benefit left her. Three days paſt in which they were not able to change her mind by prayers, tears and remonſtrances, or draw one word from her. The fourth day they came again to try their utmoſt, and getting about her upon their knees, melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into tears, offering her every thing, conjur'd her to have pity of her ſelf and of them. When <hi>Zelide</hi> had
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:62940:89"/>hearkned to them, ſetching a ſigh, with much pain ſhe ſate up in her Bed. Then they knew the extremity to which ſhe was reduc'd. In the faireſt face of the World they ſaw an affrighting image of deſpair, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching death; and ſomething which ſtruck them with fear and pity at once. When they had look'd upon one another for ſome time, at laſt ſhe broke that Silence which ſhe had ſo long kept, and ſpake to them after this manner:</p>
            <p>My Friends, you ask me a thing which none but you can give me. You pray me to live. I pray you, that I may. And 'tis in your power, not in mine. I have reſolv'd I will not be carried alive to the ſhore of <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly:</hi> and I ſwear it again by the gods above, by the Fire and by the Light; by thoſe below, and by the ſhades of my Parents. It is not then in me to diſpoſe otherwiſe of my ſelf. And ſeeing you can carry me, or not carry me thither; you muſt pronounce the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of my life or death. Can you now refuſe me that, which you have beg'd of me with ſo many tears? And will you be my Murtherers, that were choſen for my Conducters? The Duke of <hi>Tarant</hi> expects me; but hath never ſeen me. Here's your Neece, of my age, my ſtature, and not much unlike me. You may put her in my place; and procure her this good For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and deliver me from the greateſt misfortune in the World. 'Tis true, you will deceive the Duke by another perſon than he expects: but if you could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct me in the condition wherein I am, would it be <hi>Zelide?</hi> And is not this Maid more like to what I was, than I am to my ſelf? Will not the Duke be more happy to have a Wife that will be content, and who wiſhes for him, than one that long conſider'd, whether ſhe ſhould chooſe death or him? and which at laſt prefer'd death to his perſon? But 'tis not mine he loves, ſeeing it is unknown to him; 'tis my Fortunes,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:62940:90"/>which I now make over to your Neece, with the name of <hi>Zelide:</hi> and call the gods to witneſs, that for me no perſon alive ſhall know of it, and that I will never repent of it. 'Tis true, the Queen hath commanded you to convey me where I am expected; but are not you bound to follow her will rather than her words? And don't you think that if ſhe were now preſent, and ſaw the danger in which I am, ſhe would not rather provide for my ſafety in any place, than ſend me dead for <hi>Italy?</hi> Did ſhe bid you put me into the hands of the Duke, alive or dead? Don't you think ſhe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends this Marriage for my good and advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? and that ſhe, who hath had a care of my Fortune, would have a care of my life? When all the World ſhall reproach her with this cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, will ſhe not diſcharge her ſelf upon you? But who can oblige you, except you will, to return to <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celona</hi> and give her account of what you have done? With this Ship you may go any where, where the Winds go, and you have all the World before you. Then drawing out a ſmall Cabinet the Queen had left her, containing her Mothers Jewels, ſhe told them; Theſe Jewels are of infinite value. The Queen would not give you more if ſhe preſented you <hi>Barcelona.</hi> I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent them all to you, for the ranſom of my life and liberty: and as theſe two ſurpaſs in value what I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; and that Liberty alone is worth all the Riches in the World, you may give me more than I give you, and I ſhall ſtill be your Debtor. With theſe you will find Friends, Kindred and Countrey any where. Many would be tempted to take away my life, with what I offer you to ſave it: and I incite you to a good action, by a reward capable of purchaſing others for a bad one. If you are touch'd with a ſcruple of obeying the Queen; are you not more afraid of murthering an Innocent? Can you more eaſily reſolve to kill one of
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:62940:90"/>her Friends, than to break one of her commands? Are you not more afraid of provoking the gods, than of offending men in the perſon of a Woman? And if a dread of her hatred or revenge reſtrains you, ought you not to conſider, that there are ſome in <hi>Aragon,</hi> as powerful as ſhe, who will ſeek you throughout the World, and make you give account of my perſon and life? But after all, if theſe Reaſons ſhould not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear ſo; I adjure you by that compaſſion you ſeem'd to have of me, and by the tears you lately ſhed, to deliver me out of this miſery: and by a ready complying ſhew, that it is for the love of me, rather than for your own conſideration, that you do it. But if my Reaſons, my prayers, and my offers cannot prevail; and if I cannot perſwade you to an action which is juſt, ſafe and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table: I ſhut my mouth never to open it again; and in deſpite of you, death ſhall one day give me the liberty you have refus'd. Ending this diſcourſe ſhe open'd the Cabinet and let the Stones ſparkle in their eyes. Which indeed was not one of the weakeſt means whereof ſhe ſerv'd her ſelf to perſwade them. They were mov'd with what they heard; but more by what they ſaw; and 'twas hard for them to reſiſt ſo many violences at once.</p>
            <p>The Captain was much a Souldier, and of great Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage: who had paſt the half of his life upon the Sea; and who had run many Fortunes, but made none. He thought that now ſhe would pay him all at once: and was aſtoniſh'd to ſee in ſo ſmall a ſpace, more riches than he had ever beheld in the <hi>Indies.</hi> He preſently began to think how many Ships he would build and Man out with a part of it. All <hi>Zelides</hi> Arguments appear'd good ones. He thought that generoſity oblig'd him to ſuccour a Princeſs ſo amiable, and ſo unjuſtly afflicted: and thought beſides, that if he could beſtow her in ſome place, whence he might afterwards render
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:62940:91"/>her to <hi>Alcidalis,</hi> he might return to <hi>Spain</hi> with more favour than ever; and had ground to hope as great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward hereafter, as that which he ſaw before him. When he had attentively hearkned to <hi>Zelide,</hi> he remain'd ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent a long time: and reſolv'd upon what he would do, he only ſtudied what he ſhould ſay. She believing he doubted what reſolution he ſhould take, added ſo many prayers and promiſes to what ſhe had ſaid, and knew how to preſs him in ſuch a manner, that at laſt ſeeming to render himſelf up to her Reaſons and to pity, he ſwore by ſolemn Oaths to do what ſhe deſir'd. <hi>Zelide,</hi> who hitherto in the height of her misfortunes and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair had never dropt a tear, felt her ſelf now ſtirr'd with joy, and a pity ſhe had of her ſelf, reflecting on her condition, and began to weep abundantly, as mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable perſons are wont to do, when in their griefs ſome glimpſe of hope darts in upon them. She did not think ſo much of her being ſnatch'd from the arms of <hi>Alcidalis,</hi> as of her being deliver'd from falling into the Dukes. With the help of this Joy ſhe ſoon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd her ſtrength; and re-eſtabliſh'd her health in as few days as ſhe had loſt it. They agreed then, ſhe ſhould not ſhew her ſelf: and <hi>Erminia</hi> their Neece was ſhut up in a Cabin, and receiv'd Leſſons to act well the part of <hi>Zelide.</hi> At laſt they came near the Shore, and they ſuffer'd her, being well inſtructed, to be ſeen by the principal Officers of the Gallies, and ſhe rehears'd before them the part ſhe was to play upon a more noble Theater. Though <hi>Zelide</hi> ſaw things well diſpos'd, and the extream paſſion her Guardians had to bring about their deſign, her heart fail'd her when ſhe ſaw the Land. In the mean time, that they might not expoſe the falſe <hi>Zelide</hi> to the eyes of the Croud, which co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd the Shore, as ſoon as ſhe was Landed they put her into a cloſe Chair, pretending her indiſpoſition, and ſo convey'd her to the Palace: and they advis'd her,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:62940:91"/>with the ſame pretext to ſhun the ſight of People, and to keep her Bed till ſhe had fortified her action and countenance, and was well accuſtom'd to be a Dutcheſs. So that ſhe was ſeen of none but the Duke; who, though he did not find in her that great Beauty which had made ſo much noiſe; was content, and attributed ſomething to her ſickneſs and a Sea Voyage: or at leaſt to the deceitfulneſs of Fame. The Captain and his Wife, laden with Preſents, took leave and went to Sea. When they were return'd, and that <hi>Zelide</hi> ſaw the Ship was under Sail, and ſhe at diſtance from this fatal Shore, which ſhe had ſo much fear'd; ſhe was fill'd with ſuch a Joy, that it wanted little but the pleaſure of leaving <hi>Italy</hi> made amends for the grief ſhe felt in leaving <hi>Spain.</hi> But what ſerves it for an unfortunate perſon to ſcape one Misfortune? And what ſafety for thoſe that Fortune purſues? All the Earth, without doubt, is of her Empire. But the Sea ſeems to be her proper Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance. 'Tis there ſhe is moſt to be fear'd; and there are wrought her greateſt miracles and greateſt perfidies. In the mean time, as if there were nothing to be fear'd, <hi>Zelide</hi> thankt the gods: and being upon the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful Element of all, in a weak Veſſel, and amongſt people from whom ſhe could expect nothing, having no more to give them, ſhe is in the ſame aſſurance as if ſhe were upon the Land, in a Palace, and amongſt her Friends. They made for <hi>Sardinia,</hi> to which place the Captain deſign'd to carry the young Princeſs, and commit her to the care of a Siſter of his, till he could find means to put her into the power of <hi>Alcidalis.</hi> After a few days ſail with a favourable Wind, one Evening they deſcry'd three Sail.</p>
            <p>There is no place where men live with ſo much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt, as upon this Element. The Water, Air, Earth and Fire are enemies to Voyagers. But men are more ſo, and amidſt ſo many dangers there is nothing a Veſſel
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:62940:92"/>fears more, than the encounter of another. This News rouz'd them all, they made all fail poſſible, and the Night came on, but in the Morning they found them by their ſide. Then aſtoniſhment ſeiz'd upon them; the moſt fearful betook themſelves to Cries and Tears, and the moſt reſolute to their Arms. And the wiſeſt judg'd the one and the other were equally in vain. Though the Captain had experience enough to judge that he could not defend himſelf, nevertheleſs a regret to looſe ſo much Riches, and to ſee that Fortune would ſnatch out of his hands what ſhe but now gave him, put him in deſpair, and made him reſolve to die rather than yield. In this general alarm and confuſion <hi>Zelide</hi> only was unaffrighted: and whilſt others fear'd for their Goods, Lives and Liberty; ſhe, to whom all theſe things were indifferent, thought of preſerving that ſhe eſteem'd moſt. After ſhe had fac'd the danger with a firm and reſolv'd mind, ſhe ſhut her ſelf up in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin with the Captains Wiſe. The firſt thing ſhe did was to throw the Cabinet of Jewels into the Sea, leſt ſhe ſhould be diſcover'd by them. After that ſhe pray'd her to cut her Hair: and then with Tears in her eyes, ſeeing what Fortune conſtrain'd her to, made her bring a Sute of her Husbands Clothes, which ſhe put on. In the mean time the Ships, now known to be of <hi>Africa,</hi> were within Canon-ſhot, and finding that our Ship pretended to defend her ſelf, diſcharg'd a Broad-ſide; ours did the ſame, but with different ſucceſs; for having done no hurt to the Enemy it loſt Maſt and Sails. At this noiſe <hi>Zelide</hi> came out, and put her ſelf amongſt the moſt reſolute, and where there was moſt danger: believing by this means ſhe ſhould find her death, or better diſguiſe her ſelf. The Combat was ſo unequal it could not laſt long. The <hi>Corſairs</hi> quickly boarded the Ship; where having kill'd ten or twelve of the ſtouteſt, and amongſt them the Captain, the reſt ask their lives. The Commander of
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:62940:92"/>theſe Veſſels was of of the Kingdom of <hi>Bareba,</hi> a part of <hi>Africa</hi> which confines on one ſide with <hi>Egypt,</hi> on the other with <hi>Nubia.</hi> Theſe people, extreamly Savage, know not what-Commerce is; and have no other way of communicating with Strangers, but by vanquiſhing of them, and carrying away Merchants and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize: What we call Stealing, they ſay is to gain upon the Enemy; and call that Valour, which we ſtyle Piracy. What they can have at the price of their Blood, they would be aſham'd to get otherwiſe: and to take a thing by force and with danger, is amongſt them the moſt honeſt ſort of acquiſition. This man being of the nobleſt and moſt powerful of his Nation, had been for a long time the terrour of the <hi>Grecian</hi> and <hi>Italian</hi> Coaſts, able and extreamly valiant; pitiful and humane, more than his Countrey or Trade permitted; good and generous, without knowing what goodneſs or generoſity was. As in the coldeſt parts of the North there are found ſome veins of Gold as fine as that of the <hi>Indies,</hi> though not in ſo great quantity: ſo in all ſorts of Climates, Nature is pleas'd ſometimes to produce rich diſpoſitions, which ſhe inſtructs and dreſſes up her ſelf; and beſtows upon them, without their ſtudy, all neceſſary lights. When <hi>Orchant,</hi> which was the name of the <hi>Corſaire,</hi> view'd his Captives and the prey he had made; the Beauty and Majeſty which ſparkled in the face of <hi>Zelide</hi> ſtruck his ſight: and asking who ſhe was; ſhe ſaid, ſhe was a <hi>Spaniard</hi> by Nation, and nam'd her ſelf <hi>Zelidan,</hi> Couſin to the Captain of the Ship he had taken; that ſhe was ſorry ſhe could not follow him; and that ſhe eſteem'd him happy to have loſt his life rather than his liberty. She ſaid this with a Countenance that held nothing of the Captive; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out tears, without prayers, without ſubmiſſions. But in ſpite of her ſelf her face and good grace pleaded for her; and her Conſtancy and Courage were recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:62940:93"/>enough. So that <hi>Orchant</hi> eſteem'd her Pride; and what would have invited the anger of another, bred admiration in him. He exhorted him to be of good courage; that his Servitude ſhould not be harſh; that he ſhould taſte more liberty than before; that he might hope 'twould not laſt, ſeeing he had a Maſter who kept no Slaves, but thoſe who deſerv'd to be ſo: that for his part, he did not practiſe the Sea as a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant; that he rather ſought Fame than Gain; that he took more pleaſure in making Free-men, than in making Slaves: that for his part of the Booty, he would content himſelf with <hi>Zelidan,</hi> and leave the reſt to his Souldiers: that he might ranſom himſelf when he would; that one gallant Action would be enough to do it; that if the reſt of him anſwer'd to his face, he might believe he ſhould be longer his Friend than his Slave. <hi>Zelide,</hi> who expected nothing like this from a Barbarian and a Pirate, was glad, and wonder'd at his diſcourſe, eſteeming her Captivity much more ſupportable. And now having ſhun'd an odious Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, ſee her the Slave of a Pirate: and ſhe thought this Accident leſs afflicting than the other, becauſe it had more remedies. There was no good fortune for her, but to be <hi>Alcidalis</hi>'s; nor ill, but to be anothers. Beſides this, ſhe knew no good nor evil in the World; and all things were indifferent to her. Thus ſhe who deſerv'd to command the Univerſe, reſolves to ſerve: and that heart which was ſo vaſt and elevate, that the Heavens are not more, ſtoops to the loweſt of Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes, with more patience than the meaneſt Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner taken with her. But it was impoſſible for <hi>Zelide</hi> to ſerve long. This diſorder and violence could not laſt in nature. It had been eaſier to ſubmit the ſphere of Fire to the other Elements: and it was impoſſible but thoſe divine qualities which were in her, ſhould be known and admir'd. Beſides that the Heavens had
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:62940:93"/>beſtow'd on her all Beauties in perfection; and the charms of body and mind, together with all the graces which breed love and reſpect: ſhe was born under ſuch a ſtrong Conſtellation of Empire and Command, that ſhe would have been obey'd by the moſt Savage Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, and eaſily gain'd Authority over reaſonable Souls. So that <hi>Zelidan,</hi> for we muſt accuſtome our ſelves to call her ſo, became the Maſter of his Maſter. Slaves, Mariners, Souldiers equally lov'd her, and he abſolutely Commanded in the Veſſel where he was Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner. Conſidering the paſſion <hi>Orchant</hi> had for him, he gueſt how eaſily this Friendſhip would convert into Love, if he were known; and that in this caſe, that affection which might be ſome way a ſuccour to him, would be the inevitable cauſe of his loſs. He took care then to conceal himſelf: and the better to do it, reſolv'd to oppoſe his Courage to all ſorts of dangers, and to inure himſelf to thoſe things wereof this Sex does not ſeem capable.</p>
            <p>They paſt that Summer without making any Port, except for Water; often changing courſe and deſign; following the Winds, and the way they thought they might furniſh prize. In which time <hi>Zelidan</hi> ſignaliz'd her ſelf in all occaſions that offer'd; running where danger was moſt apparent without Armour, and the moſt raſh remain'd behind her. There are no inchanted Arms like thoſe of good Fortune, not Buckler which covers like hers. Thoſe ſhe defends may run naked upon Swords points; but for thoſe ſhe bears ill-will to, Armour of proof will be faulty. Now, the hopes <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant</hi> had conceiv'd of her became a confirm'd opinion, and an eſteem ſolidly eſtabliſh'd.</p>
            <p>'Twas neceſſary we ſhould leave <hi>Alcidalis,</hi> and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary we leave him no longer. For his firſt grief could not be deſcrib'd; and at firſt 'twas impoſſible to repreſent all his ſighs, tears, rages and ſuries. Having
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:62940:94"/>ſeen the Queen return without <hi>Zelide;</hi> and having been eight days without being able to diſcover what was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of her; he paſt that time in a mortal ſadneſs and inquietude. But when he came to know the hiſtory of her Misfortune, and knew the Evil was without remedy; when he conſider'd her in the arms of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and that his Imagination had preſented to him whatever might torment him: Then his tears ceas'd, and deſpair ſeiz'd him; then he loſt all ſorts of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects and fears; he lowdly threatned the Queen; and teſtify'd all thoſe reſentments, which higheſt wrongs can breed in the greateſt heart in the World. He was two days deliberating, if he ought firſt to revenge himſelf on the Queen, or go and raviſh <hi>Zelide</hi> from the hands of him that poſſeſt her, or rather rid him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of his miſeries by a voluntary death. But at laſt his body, which for ſome time had as 'twere nouriſh'd it ſelf with poyſon, ſunk under ſo many evils, and put an end to the tranſports of his mind. A Feaver ſeiz'd him, which at firſt was accompanied with ſuch furious fits as gave fear to all the World: and thoſe who knew the cauſe of his diſeaſe, believed this would be the end of it. In few days he became forceleſs; and, which was well for him, without knowledge, without ſenſe. So all thoſe thoughts, which his different paſſions croud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into his mind, were dampt; and he that would paſs the Seas and run through the World, was detain'd in his bed for four Months. A Feaver, Love and Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, that is, the greateſt Evils of body and mind e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually conſum'd him: and each of them were in him to ſuch a height, and with ſuch circumſtances, that there was no probability any one of them was capable of remedy. But Nature would not loſe the faireſt piece that ever paſs'd her hands: and ſhe had in him ſo much force and vigour, that againſt all reaſon and againſt his own mind ſhe return'd him to health. And
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:62940:94"/>now having leſs of Sickneſs he had more of Sorrow: and not being able to ſtay till he had recover'd his ſtrength, he left <hi>Saragoſa,</hi> and imbarking at the firſt Port went for <hi>Italy</hi> with ſome ſhadow of Joy, in think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he ſcap'd the hands of his Enemies and follow'd the footſteps of <hi>Zelide.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The falſe <hi>Zelide</hi> had Fortune more favourable than the other; and her deſigns proſper'd better. She had a midling Beauty, and that ſort of Wit which is proper for Craft. Seeing the danger of her attempt, ſhe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd by all ways to gain the heart of her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and to fortifie her ſelf againſt all Accidents that might happen. He was in that ſeaſon of his life where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the approaches of Age begin to give men diſtruſt of themſelves, and wherein they ought not to hope for love from any Women, but thoſe who are by duty oblig'd to it: ſo that the Beauty, behaviour, and kindneſs of his Wife eaſily gain'd him. As Flowers are never ſo acceptable to us, as at the beginning of the Spring or end of Autumn; thoſe for their novelty, and theſe becauſe we think we ſhall quickly loſe them: the pleaſures of Love do not in any Seaſon touch us ſo ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly as in the firſt youth, or decline of our Age. 'Tis ſo great a ſatisfaction and rare a pleaſure for an Old man to be belov'd, that there are none which upon this opinion do not become young, and kindle their aſhes again. But likewiſe, as the Sun ſhining far off us makes the longeſt ſhadows: when Love ſhines in this Age, from which 'tis naturally diſtant, it cauſes largeſt Shadows. As ſoon as the Duke felt himſelf amorous, he became Jealous. This paſſion, which is elſewhere a fortuitous effect of Love, is an inſeparable Accident in all men of this Climate. They do not believe a great deſire can ſubſiſt without a great fear: and Love and Jealouſie are the two Twins, which are always here born together. Whether then the exceſs of his affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:62940:95"/>wrought the effect, or the Air of the Countrey, or the ſuſpicious humour which years brought along with them; or whether he had notice of <hi>Alcidalis</hi> paſſion: his diſtruſt arriv'd to that point, that he was not ſafe but when the Dutcheſs was in his ſight. And beſides, 'twas with impatience, that he ſuffer'd her to be ſeen by any eyes but his own. She, who for another reaſon fear'd nothing more than to be ſeen, eaſily met his humour: and pretending to pleaſe him, ſaid, ſhe equally loy'd all the effects of his paſſion; that his fear for her pleas'd her, ſeeing 'twas a proof of his Love; however, ſhe would try all ways to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie him, and that he needed not take care for any thing but his own quiet. For her part, ſhe would be always content if he were: and ſeeing that he was to her inſtead of all things, ſhe would believe ſhe poſſeſt all, when ſhe poſſeſt him. He received theſe offers with much content: and uſed the liberty ſhe gave him in taking away hers. So that daily paring away ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, from a great Palace and an infinite number of Servants, ſhe is reduc'd to a few Chambers, a Gallery, and five or ſix Women. As the Duke gave her proofs of his Jealouſie, he would alſo give her ſome of his Love: and ſatisfying himſelf, he ſtrove likewiſe to content her. There was nothing rare either in <hi>Europe</hi> or the <hi>Indies,</hi> which he did not cauſe to be bought for her. Whatever was precious in the World, the richeſt workmanſhip of Nature, the moſt accompliſh'd Maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieces of Art adorn'd her Cabinets. She had, in fine, the faireſt Priſon we can imagine, if any Priſon can be ſaid to be fair: and ſhe ſaw whatever ſhe could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, except men. But becauſe the moſt pleaſing Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude has always ſomewhat of Melancholy, he would remedy that too. With great care and expence he ſought out the handſomeſt and ſtrongeſt Slaves. And having got a great number, he caus'd them to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:62940:95"/>by the beſt Maſters of <hi>Italy,</hi> in all exerciſes wherein the Nobility are wont to excel. Theſe were call'd the Dutcheſs Slaves, and wore her Livery: they had no other mark of Servitude but a Ring of Gold about their necks, with a Chain faſten'd to it, and a Medal of their Miſtreſſes Arms. Three times a week they enter'd a ſpacious Court, which anſwer'd to the Windows of her Gallery: and there they exercis'd. The Duke invented this for two ends; one to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Dutcheſs, who was extreamly belov'd by him; the other, to make her deſpiſe all men by letting her fee in Slaves, that is, in the vileſt perſons among them, the ſame qualities which are found in thoſe moſt No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly deſcended, and which render them conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alcidalis</hi> coming to <hi>Italy</hi> underſtood all this; and having conſider'd ſome time, he thought no quality could become him better than to be <hi>Zelides</hi> Slave; and that the greatneſs of his Fortune having caus'd all his Misfortunes, he could not cure them better than by putting himſelf into the loweſt ſtate. He imparted his deſign to him that accompanied him. Who ſeigning himſelf to be a Merchant, went to thoſe who govern'd this Troop. They ſeeing in <hi>Alcidalis</hi> all the qualities they ſought, quickly ſet a price upon a Perſon inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable, and with a ſmall ſum of Money bought for a Slave the Son of a King, and the moſt accompliſh'd perſon on Earth. At firſt he was a Scholar to them to whom he might have been Maſter; and ſuffer'd himſelf to be taught what he knew better than they, or any body elſe. Thus pretending every day to learn ſomething of them, he made ſuch a progreſs in a ſhort time, that he was admir'd by all. Whether he did Ride, Wreſtle, or Jump; he ſhew'd every where ſo much addreſs, ſtrength and diſpoſition, that it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to a prodigy. Horſes ſeem'd naturally to obey
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:62940:96"/>him; and that without any motion he made them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand his mind. If he were chaleng'd at Wreſtling, or at the Courſe; he ſo eaſily caſt one on the ground, and got ground of the other, that it ſeem'd he was born to be their Maſter, and that they ought always to be at his feet or much behind him. When he run on foot, Horſes had not ſuch ſpeed, and when he was on their backs, they were ſwifter than Birds. In fine, no prize was propoſed which was not his: and there was no way to make an equal match, if he were in, except he were on one ſide; and yet ſo, he did not fail to vanquiſh. In the mean time, amidſt all theſe Praiſes, he felt ſome ſhame in himſelf to contend with Slaves. He had a heart to ask Kings for his Rivals. But this was neceſſary for his deſign. Though he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd every thing with a marvellous grace, yet it was with ſo little attention, and in ſo careleſs a manner, that 'twas eaſie to perceive he thought of higher Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories. As oft as he enter'd the Courſe, and could be ſeen by the Dutcheſs, he came firſt and went away laſt. In all his Exerciſes his eyes were ſtill fixt upon the Grates, whence he believ'd ſhe beheld him, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever himſelf did or others did, could not divert them. To what blindneſſes are Men ſubject? The moſt faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of Lovers Idolizes a Beauty he never ſaw. He ſighs for her, he ſends her his heart by his eyes: and having a Miſtreſs he loves a hundred times more than himſelf, he voluntarily ſells himſelf to another. <hi>Alcidalis,</hi> who would have been remarkable amongſt the moſt accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh'd Princes in the World, was eaſily ſo among Slaves. The firſt day he enter'd his Beauty and Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour drew the Dutcheſſes eyes upon him. Soon after he gain'd her eſteem, and admiration: and having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd him better, ſhe thought ſhe beheld in the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantneſs of his port, ſomething extraordinary, and which was not of his preſent condition. She minded
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:62940:96"/>the attention with which he look'd toward her. She mark'd his ſighs, the paleneſs and grief which dwelt in his face: and how amidſt general applauſes, nothing could affect him. All this begot in her firſt Curioſity, then Pity, and at laſt Love.</p>
            <q>I have always heard you ſay, Madam, ſhe was not touch'd with this laſt paſſion, and that ſhe had only the curioſity to know a perſon, who in ſo low Fortunes ſhew'd ſuch high Indowments. But you ſhall permit me, not to be ſatisfied with what you ſay. I have heard you ſometimes excuſe perſons leſs excuſable than ſhe, and I know you are ſcrupulous to a degree of fearing to offend a perſon that never was. If you conſider the Duke was Old and Jealous; the Dutcheſs young and a Priſoner, and the Prince the moſt amiable perſon in the World, you will find, it is not a very raſh ſuſpicion to think ſhe was amorous.</q>
            <p>One Evening, as this Slave left the Palace, he felt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf pull'd aſide into a dark Entry by a Woman he did not know; who told him, Sir, if you are the gallant Man you ſeem, go to morrow two hours in the Night to the foot of the <hi>Greek</hi> Tower: where, if you ſerve your ſelf of the occaſion that will preſent, you ſhall be happier than ever you hoped to be. She ſaid this in haſte, and left him without expecting an Anſwer.</p>
            <q>It could never be imagin'd how the Dutcheſs, ſhut up and watch'd as ſhe was, could find a way to let <hi>Alcida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis</hi> underſtand her mind. You, Madam, never gave good account of it: And I remember, Madam, your Mother, who never loſt an occaſion of ſaying a handſom thing, prais'd you for having fail'd in Invention at this part of the Hiſtory. And truly 'tis very remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that when you could ſave <hi>Alcidalis</hi> in ſo many Accidents, and keep <hi>Zelide</hi> untouch'd amidſt Pirates, and bring them both to their Kingdoms after ſo many wandrings; your imagination fell ſhort in this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:62940:97"/>and you could not find a way to ſend a man a Meſſage.</q>
            <p>Since <hi>Alcidalis</hi> began to be unfortunate, he had never ſeen the leaſt glimmering of Joy but at this inſtant. He preſently thought this Meſſage came from <hi>Zelide,</hi> and with tears in his eyes thank'd Heaven, which ſeem'd to begin to take compaſſion on him. However, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Souls of great men ſee ſomething in the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of the future; or whether the miſerable dare not truſt the Promiſes of hope, wherewith they have been often abus'd: he durſt not be confident of his good Fortune; and beginning to hope he began to fear too.</p>
            <q>Here, Madam, a more eloquent Writer than I would not fail to ſay, That all the hours ſeem'd days, and all the days years: And that his amorous impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience made him count the moments; blame the ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of time, and of the Sun; and accuſe all the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens. But without ſaying all this, we may eaſily ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine the Inquietudes of <hi>Alcidalis</hi> by the cauſes he had for it.</q>
            <p>The Day, or rather the Night of the aſſignation came at laſt. And before ſhe had well thickned her ſhadows, he was at the foot of the Tower. 'Twas an Old build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing joyn'd to the Palace. Its foot was waſh'd by the waves of the Sea. The Prince had provided himſelf of a Fiſhing-Boat; which he faſtned to ſome Rings in the Wall, and attended that ſucceſs which Fortune would give to this Adventure, in the darkneſs and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the Night, which was not interrupted but by the waves of the Sea. He ſtaid an hour without ſeeing any thing: diverſly agitated with hopes and fears; which being two contrary paſſions are, for all that, often found together.</p>
            <q>He form'd all thoſe Imaginations which another may conceive; but which neither you nor I, Madam, who never knew Love, can relate.</q>
            <pb n="191" facs="tcp:62940:97"/>
            <p>At laſt, when he began to deſpair, and had thoughts as black and dreadful as the Night and Sea, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viron'd him, a noiſe he heard from above reſtor'd him his loſt hopes. He thought he heard ſome words, which he could not underſtand; to which having anſwer'd by a noiſe he made below, he heard ſomething fall into the Sea, and perceived it white upon the Water: which having reach'd to him, he knew 'twas a Ladder of Cord, to which a piece of Linnen was ty'd that he might the better ſee it. Now <hi>Alcidalis</hi> ſuffer'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be deceiv'd by the apparences of his good For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and believed ſhe would give him back ſomething of <hi>Zelide.</hi> Preſently, without conſidering the danger, and in ſpite of the Darkneſs, and Winds which blew horribly, he undertook by this dangerous way to mount to an extream height; without knowing whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he went, of whom, nor how he ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd. He at laſt finds a Window, where he perceiv'd a perſon who gave him her hand, and by many turnings and windings conducted him to a Chamber, enlightned by three Lamps of Gold, and richly adorn'd. The Woman bid him ſit down a while, and left him. Now conſidering what had paſt, and what he ſaw, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed himſelf in the opinion he had, that he was ſent for by <hi>Zelide.</hi> And in the midſt of ſo many perils which he might imagine to himſelf, by a ſecret pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiment of his Misfortune, he fear'd nothing ſo much as not to ſee her. I cannot tell you the divers thoughts he had; his impatiences, deſires, fears, diſtruſts, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicions, ſurprizes, alarms. All which cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented upon Paper: and nothing but humane mind is capable of this confuſion. He remain'd thus an hour. At laſt the ſame perſon enter'd; You will par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don me by and by Sir, ſaith ſhe to him, for making you ſtay; the Honour you are going to receive, deſerves to be ſtaid for. The Prince having thank'd her, and
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:62940:98"/>pray'd her to let him know what that Honour was; after ſome pauſe ſhe told him. If it were not eaſie to conclude the greatneſs and force of your mind by what we have ſeen of you, it would not be fit to tell you your good Fortune all at once, but give you time to uſe your ſelf to it, and to try how you could bear it. But it is to be believ'd of you, that you will not be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd, and that your thoughts are no leſs high and noble than your actions. Know then that you are in <hi>Zelides</hi> Lodgings, and in a moment you ſhall be in her Chamber. The Dutcheſs hath taken notice of all thoſe qualities which render you eſteemable: and ſeeing that there is nothing low in you but your Fortune, ſhe will take care of that her ſelf and make it better: and to this purpoſe ſhe would know who you are. Hereafter ſhew as much diſcretion and conduct, as you have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto ſhewn art and valour. With this ſhe led him to her Miſtreſſes Chamber.</p>
            <p>The weakneſs of our minds is very ſtrange. <hi>Alcida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,</hi> whom death and all that is horrible could not affright; who in ſpite of the Wind, the Night and the Sea, by a weak Ladder of Cord was got ſo high; and who durſt at Noon-day have ventur'd to deliver the Dutcheſs from the hands and power of the Duke; trembled here, where he knew there were none but Women. That heart which would fearleſly have confronted a World of Enemies, is fill'd with fear approaching the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſon he loves, and by whom he knows he is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lov'd. The Chamber was inlightned only by a Torch, and the Dutcheſs was in her bed, with that little light which ſuch enterprizes, the ſhame and aſtoniſhment of a young unexperienc'd perſon demands. So that if the Prince had been more himſelf and leſs ſurpriz'd, ſcarce could he have known his errour, and the cheat which Fortune put upon him. At firſt he put himſelf upon his knee; and having begun to ſay ſome words, which

The trouble of his mind and a troop of paſſions preſs'd him ſo, that he could not proceed: and half beſide himſelf, he fell with his head upon the Princes Bed. Who putting out her hand to remove it, he took it, and coming to himſelf, he ſaid, At laſt, <hi>Zelide,</hi> the Heavens have had pity of <hi>Alcidalis;</hi> and however they have oppos'd me, I muſt thank them for permitting me to ſee you before I die. Here his Sighs broke off his diſcourſe. And as he was begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning again, he heard a great noiſe in the Palace, and ſhe that led him in, enters amaz'd, ſaying it was the Duke, and that he was now in the Dutcheſſes Lodgings. The good Man, little imagining what paſs'd in the Palace, had left it with deſign to ſtay three days abroad a Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But whether his Love or Jealouſie call'd him back; or whether he thought it a piece of Courtſhip to ſhew his impatience and his affection to the Dutcheſs, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns the ſame day, and preſently haſtens to ſee her.</p>
            <q>I am extreamly vext he came ſo unſeaſonably. For I would fain have underſtood, what the Dutcheſs could anſwer in that aſtoniſhment ſhe muſt needs be in, hearing <hi>Alcidalis</hi> ſpeak as he did. I find him very troubleſom to arrive juſt now, and if I had made the Hiſtory, in ſpite I would have—</q>
            <p>The Dutcheſs was ſo affrighted, ſhe could not ſpeak one word. The Lady that brought the Prince in, taking him again by the hand and conducting him by the ſame way he enter'd, carried him to the Window; whence, ſeeing the treaſons of Fortune, he had a mind to preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitate himſelf, rather than deſcend.</p>

<pb n="196" facs="tcp:62940:100"/>by ways little diſcreet exaſperated the mind of <hi>Andrea,</hi> a Miniſter ſo neceſſary to him at this time. He did not pay him his aſſign'd Stipend; and after he had taken from him the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> his Priſoner of War, and ſet him at liberty, thereby defrauding him of his due Ranſom, he demanded with importunity and inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent threatnings the Marqueſs <hi>Vaſto,</hi> and <hi>Aſcanio Colon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> taken in fight by <hi>Philippino Dorea,</hi> Lieutenant to <hi>Andrea.</hi> But that which moſt pierc'd the Soul of the good Old man, was the ſmall faith of the King in complying with his Promiſe, touching the Intereſt and Reputation of the <hi>Genoueſes.</hi> The City of <hi>Savona</hi> had withdrawn it ſelf from the obedience of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth; expecting, under the protection of <hi>France,</hi> to meliorate its condition by the commodiouſneſs of the Port, which furniſh'd them with extraordinary emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luments, to the irreparable damage of the City of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noua.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Andrea</hi> had often complain'd of this to the King, praying him, that in recompence of his Services, he would reſtore to his Countrey what by all right was due to it. The King overcome by the honeſty of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, had promis'd <hi>Doria</hi> to ſatisfie him; but his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to Juſtice being combated by the hopes of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, he at laſt inclines to the worſt choice, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves to detain that City. He had ſeen by experience how inconſtant the <hi>Genoueſes</hi> were, and how little he could depend upon that Commonwealth for his War in <hi>Italy.</hi> For tyranniz'd by factions it eaſily chang'd its form of Government, according to the different prevailing humours: therefore eſteeming it neceſſary for his deſigns to have a Port at his devotion commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious for the Affairs of <hi>Lombardy,</hi> he choſe <hi>Savona,</hi> and gave the charge of it to <hi>Momorancy.</hi> Conceiving, that with this determination he had at once bridled the inconſtancy of the <hi>Genoueſes,</hi> and greatly advantag'd
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:62940:100"/>the courſe of his Enterprize; becauſe the City of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vona</hi> being near to <hi>Piemont, Montferrat</hi> and <hi>Lombardy,</hi> it became an opportune Scale, no leſs for Merchandize than for War. Hence 'twas fear'd, that in a few years growing in Reputation and Riches, it might not only divert the Trade from the Port of <hi>Genoua,</hi> but rival it with them for the principality of that Sea. Of this <hi>Doria,</hi> as a ſingular lover of his Countrey, ſharply complain'd. But at laſt ſeeing it was in vain, he turns his mind to other Counſels. In the mean while grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cold in his devotions to the King, he by degrees ſlackned his wonted diligence in ſerving him: and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected <hi>Philippino</hi> how to comport himſelf in the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The <hi>French,</hi> who beſieg'd <hi>Naples</hi> under <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trech,</hi> quickly found the damage they receiv'd by the voluntary negligence of <hi>Philippino:</hi> for he who but little before had with incredible Valour worſted the Imperial Navy, now could not hinder a few Barks from entring into <hi>Naples</hi> with Proviſions: And this was the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the ruine of that deſign. Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the Seventh underſtanding how <hi>Doria</hi> was alienated from the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> ſeriouſly admoniſh'd the King by his Legat, to provide ſpeedy remedy for this Evil, by giving ſatisfaction to a Captain of ſo much reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſo powerful at Sea, leſt being provok'd to paſs over to the Service of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> he ſhould carry with him all hopes of the approaching Victory. He ſent like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to <hi>Doria</hi> his Secretary <hi>Sanga,</hi> to mitigate his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentments. They now deliberated in the Kings Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil on this important affair. Some amongſt them pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Doria</hi> as a man too proud in the uſe of his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and eſteeming it impoſſible to gain him counſel'd, that he ſhould be cut off; preventing by a ſudden vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence thoſe deſigns, which by gentler ways could hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be impeded, ſo depriving <hi>Caeſar</hi> of that Aid, which in the preſent conjuncture would be of much avail to
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:62940:101"/>him. Accordingly neceſſary Orders were given to <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bigios,</hi> who paſs'd into <hi>Italy</hi> with the charge of Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. <hi>Doria</hi> in the mean time having notice hereof, and deteſting that ingratitude and perfidiouſneſs with which the <hi>French</hi> Miniſters would have recompenc'd his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, treated with the Marqueſs <hi>Vaſto,</hi> his Priſoner, about ſerving the Emperour; by whom being gladly receiv'd, he openly renounc'd the Friendſhip of the <hi>French</hi> King, and return'd him the Collar and Order of St. <hi>Michael.</hi> The firſt Conditions he made with <hi>Caeſar,</hi> were ſuch as might be hoped for from a Citizen, who dearly lov'd his Countrey; to wit, the liberty of <hi>Genoua</hi> under the Imperial protection, and the redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing <hi>Savona:</hi> the reſt reſpected principally his own profit and reputation. The reſolution of <hi>Doria</hi> did in ſuch a manner ſtartle the drowſie King, that willing to correct his paſt neglects with preſent ſollicitouſneſs, he begins to ſtudy how he might bring him back on Honourable terms. But his Repentance came too late. For <hi>Doria</hi> altogether intent upon the freeing of his Countrey from the yoak of Strangers, would admit of no Conditions that might retard the execution of his deſigns. The King notwithſtanding as impatient to recover, as he had been careleſs in keeping him, with diminution of Decorum and Majeſty, deſcended of his own accord to offer him all that ſatisfaction which he had formerly deny'd; and, which was worſe, without firſt ſecretly trying by means of Friends how <hi>Doria</hi> ſtood inclin'd, he proſtituted the Royal dignity to the ignominy of a Repulſe. Which being return'd moſt preciſe and reſolute, it is not to be imagin'd, how it fill'd the Kings mind with vexation and ſhame.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doria</hi> now in the Service of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> with twelve Gallies apply'd himſelf to procure the liberty of his Countrey, which had ever been the ſole Object of his thoughts. The Commonwealth at this time was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:62940:101"/>a prey to the will of the Common people; who putting no difference between private Licenſe and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Liberty, under the name of the Common good fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with continual tumults the paſſions of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars. And when one Faction found it ſelf weak in its own Forces, having recourſe to Strangers, they intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd a new form of Government. Thus one while the <hi>Adorni</hi> drave out the <hi>Fregoſi,</hi> and anon were driven out by them: Governours from <hi>Millan</hi> were call'd, and ſent away again: the <hi>French</hi> yoke accepted, and ſhaken off. So that the wounds in the body of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth were ſtill kept open by change of Plaiſters, which had need of being well clos'd by Concord. All which <hi>Doria</hi> conſidering came before <hi>Genoua</hi> with his Gallies, to give heat to the good will of thoſe, who together with himſelf deſir'd the Common good: nor was he deceiv'd in his thoughts. For divers Citizens tir'd with the calamities of paſt Diſcord, apply'd themſelves to more wholſom Counſels, deſiring a good and firm Union. The City was now govern'd in the name of the <hi>French</hi> King by <hi>Triultio,</hi> who having be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore acquir'd the reputation of a valiant and prudent Captain, it begot the more wonder in all mens minds, when they conſider'd how little this action of his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſponded to that praiſe which was due to the reſt. For though he underſtood that the diſcourſes and deſigns of the <hi>Genoueſes</hi> did tend to Peace, he took no care to diſturb them: either becauſe he eſteem'd it a meer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation of private Enmities between the Nobility and People; or becauſe he rely'd too much upon the Kings Forces and his own Valour: not conſidering, that <hi>Genoua</hi> put into his hands by civil Diſcord, might be ſnatch'd from him only by Union. <hi>Doria</hi> thus valuing himſelf, both upon the good diſpoſition of the Citizens, and the opportunity preſented him by <hi>Triultio,</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to conduct his Enterprize to its end: which he
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:62940:102"/>did ſo happily, that without bloodſhed he got the City, driving thence the <hi>French</hi> Garriſon. Being receiv'd by the <hi>Genoueſes</hi> with incredible demonſtrations of Joy, and perſwaded by ſeveral to open his boſom to the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of Fortune, which offer'd him the Dominion of <hi>Liguria,</hi> with a mind ſuperiour to Worldly happineſs, he refus'd it. Afterwards by a weighty Speech, and worthy the Father of his Countrey, he exhorted the Citizens at laſt to know themſelves, and for the future to maintain that Liberty which he freely beſtow'd upon them. The City of <hi>Genoua</hi> oblig'd by ſo many benefits deſir'd to ſhew efficacious ſigns of a true gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude; wherefore, granting to him and his poſterity large Priviledges, they erected a Marble Statue, and by certain words ingrav'd in the Baſe thereof, declar'd him the Author of the publick Liberty. He now grown Old retires himſelf, and enjoys in the boſom of his Coutrey the fruit of that Victory and quiet which himſelf had procur'd. He had with him <hi>Giannettino</hi> his Couſin, a young Man of great Spirit and known Vertue; and who had merited by his Valour to be his Adopted Son and deſtin'd Succeſſour in his Charge at Sea, with the conſent of <hi>Caeſar.</hi> Thus, by reaſon of the quality of this Excellent perſon, eſteem'd by all Princes, rich, no leſs in Fame than in Fortune; and for the Reverence the <hi>Ganoueſes</hi> bore him as the publick Benefactor, his Houſe was frequented, not as that of a ſimple Citizen, but as of ſome great Prince. Theſe things thus ſummarily deſcrib'd, were the true cauſes of <hi>Fieſchi's</hi> Conſpiracy. With a memorable Example to all Free Cities of the incredible dammage which the Greatneſs of an eminent Citizen, though never ſo Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and diſcreet, is to the Publick; and of that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, which moved the <hi>Athenians</hi> to publiſh their Law of Oſtraciſm.</p>
            <pb n="201" facs="tcp:62940:102"/>
            <p>Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the Third and the King of <hi>France</hi> were they which envy'd <hi>Genona's</hi> publick, and <hi>Doria</hi>'s pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate happineſs; becauſe by that, Cities being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn from the Service of the <hi>French,</hi> and put under the protection of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> ſprung up extraordinary ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacles to the Affairs of <hi>Millan,</hi> which the Pope would gladly have ſeen favourable to the King; as well to curb in ſome meaſure the power of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> now formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable to all; as to vindicate himſelf for the impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he receiv'd, in advancing one of his Family to that Dukedom. Nor could they endure, that <hi>Doria</hi> the only Author and promoter hereof ſhould remain in an Honourable repoſe a Spectatour of others Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes.</p>
            <p>They now expected ſome Accident which might miniſter an occaſion to their deſigns. But that oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity which they could not find, was put into their hands by Fortune, not yet intirely reconcil'd to the <hi>Genoueſes. Gio Luigi de Fieſchi,</hi> a young man of great Spirit and turbulent humour, was at this time compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing how he might better his Reputation and Degree. He was deſcended of Noble Parentage; rich no leſs in Adherence and Followers, than in Vaſſals and Eſtate. Not contented for all this with that Honourable condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which deſcended to him from his Anceſtors, he ſuffer'd himſelf to be hurried by the heats of his Age and by Ambition, the ordinary diſeaſe of the Nobility, to dangerous hopes. From a Boy he gave manifeſt ſigns of an immature fierceneſs, from which wife men collected, that he grew up for the diſturbance of his Countreys Peace. To theſe pernicious Incentives of his Nature was added a bad Education, the incurable peſt of Youth; for though his Maſter, <hi>Paolo Panſa,</hi> was both Learn'd and Vertuous, thoſe with whom he moſt freely convers'd were dangerous perſons, who employ'd their skill by Flatteries to nouriſh in his mind perverſe
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:62940:103"/>and novel deſigns, ſtyling them Noble and Generous. Nor (as 'twas ſaid) was his Mother wanting to add Fuel to this growing flame. For, more ambitious than conſiderate, ſhe often wounded the mind of her Son with bitter Reproaches, as if he poorly contenting himſelf with a private Fortune did degenerate from his Anceſtours, who in their Countrey and out of it, were wont to ſuſtain the greateſt Dignities. And to make all ſure, he (by the Advice of his Friends) gave himſelf to read and ſtudy the Life of <hi>Nero, Catilines</hi> Conſpiracy, and <hi>Machiavels</hi> Prince. From which Books he did ſuck in priciples of Cruelty, Perfidiouſneſs, and love of Private Intereſt, above divine or humane Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. So much force hath good or ill to change even the will of the Reader, when convey'd by a powerful Pen, and apt to perſwade.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who watch'd over Advantages to ruine <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noua,</hi> had penetrated the Qualities of <hi>Gio. Luigi,</hi> and believ'd him a fitting Inſtrument for their important deſign. They endeavour'd by all ways to put him upon the action, ſetting before him the Profit and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of it. Amongſt others, <hi>Caeſare Fregoſo</hi> attempted him in the name of the <hi>French</hi> King, whereof <hi>Doria</hi> had notice, but the Advice did not find belief with the Old man, who was preoccupied with an affection to <hi>Gio. Luigi,</hi> and with his own opinion, founded upon the incertainty of vain Conjectures. Nor was the Pope wanting to invite him to it, and he being then in the Popes ſtate cauſed four Gallies to be ſold him by the Duke of <hi>Piacenza.</hi> Where likewiſe Cardinal <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ultio,</hi> Protector of <hi>France,</hi> gave him a Viſit, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him a man greedy of Fame, ſpake to him after this manner:</p>
            <p>If Fortune were propitious to your Vertue, Noble Youth, I might be happy to ſee you in a condition far above that of a private Citizen. But ſeeing through
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:62940:103"/>the Iniquity of the Times your rewards do not go e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual with your merits, take in good part that I pity your condition, and joyn with all good men to wiſh you better Fortune. Your Birth and Parts have made your Advancement the ſubject of all their Vows, who deſire the Common good: and I, who by the height of my place have a fair proſpect into the Affairs of the World, cannot but wiſh you had a larger Theater o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd for ſo much Valour. You are born in Times ſo calamitous, that in your own City 'tis not lawful to aim at Eminency: becauſe it being reduc'd to a Civil equality, will not endure you other than a meer Citizen. Beſides, that <hi>Andrea</hi> and <hi>Giannettin Doria</hi> have, under pretence of publick Liberty, ſo firmly rooted their Power, that the greateſt publick Concord conſiſts in ſerving their Wills. Thus the <hi>Genoueſes</hi> have chaſtis'd themſelves for that blind reſolution, which withdrew them from the dominion of a Potent Prince, by their ſo tamely ſubjecting themſelves to the tyranny of two private Men. They, upheld by <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and formidable by a good number of Ships, will not ſuffer a noble and generous Spirit; but will look upon the Vertue of an eminent Citizen, as dangerous to the growing For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes of their Family. They will value themſelves upon the ſpecious names of Fathers of their Countrey, and Reſtorers of its loſt Liberty, to oppreſs the braveſt Men under pretence of the Common good. So that under their Empire you ſhall be more ſure of Injuries than of Life: and if all this hath not hapned hitherto, impute it to the unripe Greatneſs of <hi>Doria,</hi> and the moderation of <hi>Andrea,</hi> who gives check to the raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of <hi>Giannettin.</hi> He being of a proud and impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent nature, when he ſhall ſee himſelf girt about with his own Forces, and for the importance of his Charge reverenc'd by all the Nobility, what is it which he will not make lawful for his Power? Do you think that
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:62940:104"/>his thirſt of Rule, provok'd by his approaching hopes, will be extinguiſh'd by any thing but the Blood of the Innocent? Do you believe, that content with the Greatneſs which his over partial Fortune and Folly of the Citizens hath inveſted him with, he will die with the bare name of <hi>Giann. Doria?</hi> I for my part cannot think ſo. He is not of that moderation, that either he ſhould know how, or be willing to ſtop the courſe of his extream felicity. He expects, I imagine, the death of <hi>Andrea,</hi> and then by a wicked Invaſion ſtaining all his famous Actions, done in behalf of his Countrey, he will uſurp the Command of it. But let us ſuppoſe the Divine goodneſs prevents theſe deſigns, can his preſent height be endur'd by a well-born Citizen? If you have not hitherto taſted of his Inſolencies, you are oblig'd to the tenderneſs of your years, not to his good Manners: but hereafter you will find yourſelf involv'd in the Common miſery. You, you I ſay, amongſt the reſt ſhall be ſeen to viſit, accompany and ſerve him; <hi>Giannettin</hi> ſhall be able to number amongſt the Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phies of his intolerable Inſolence, that <hi>Gio. Luigi de Fieſchi,</hi> Earl of <hi>Lavagna,</hi> and Lord of ſo many Vaſſals, courted him, reverenc'd him, and bow'd to him. How much better were it, that awaking your mind to Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions worthy of your Countrey, Family, and Vertue, you ſhould deliver all others and your ſelf from this Servitude? And can you want Forces, when you pleaſe to uſe them? Before you leave <hi>Rome,</hi> you ſhall be furniſh'd with all neceſſary Aids. I can promiſe you the aſſiſtance of the King of <hi>France.</hi> In <hi>Genoua</hi> the Common people ever at variance with the Nobility, ſhall be to you a Sword and Shield. <hi>Giannettin</hi> ſleeping in the arms of his good Fortune, will fall an eaſie prey into your Nets; your own Subjects, and thoſe of the Duke of <hi>Piacenza,</hi> will be able to defend you againſt any Force that can be rais'd. In ſhort, all things invite
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:62940:104"/>you to Victory: only wants your own determination, not to fight, but to triumph. Conſider, 'tis neceſſary you command or ſerve; either render your ſelf formidable to others, or live in perpetual fear.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Triultio</hi> could not have touch'd his mind in a part more ſenſible: for having long envied the Greatneſs of <hi>Doria,</hi> he look'd upon <hi>Giannettin</hi> as a reproach to his own tameneſs: So that having his Will well prepared, he ſoon took fire from this ſpark the Cardinal adminiſtred. When he had greedily hearkned to the Conditions pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded in the name of the King, he did not think them deſpiſable; and they were the following, That he ſhould preſently receive money for the maintaining ſix Gallies; That he ſhould be ſecur'd of Pay for two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred men, to be put into his Caſtle of <hi>Montobby;</hi> That he ſhould receive twelve thouſand Crowns <hi>per annum</hi> for his proviſion. Which Conditions were ſoon after confirm'd to him by the Kings Order. He gave now good hopes of himſelf; not only by that alteration which <hi>Triultio</hi> quickly ſpy'd in him, but by words; yet reſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his laſt Reſolution to his return for <hi>Genoua.</hi> Where being arriv'd, he began more diligently to obſerve the proceedings of <hi>Giannettin:</hi> for though the ſplendour of the Family deriv'd it ſelf chiefly from the perſon of <hi>Andrea;</hi> yet becauſe moſt worſhip the riſing Sun, the eyes of all were turn'd upon <hi>Giannettin.</hi> He having in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd his natural pride by a Military education, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reverenc'd for the Command he had of 20 Gallies, and for the ſucceſſion in the Admiralſhip deſign'd him by <hi>Caeſar,</hi> heightned alſo by ſeveral Proofs he had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of his perſonal Valour, had drank in Conceits far beyond the condition of a private Citizen: whence, not caring to acquire by Courteſie thoſe men, which he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd were oblig'd to him by Intereſt, he ſtudied more the oſtentation of his own power, than others good will.
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:62940:105"/>For all this, he was much hated by the popular Faction: and the young Nobility which follow'd him, were drawn by the profit they hop'd to reap from him, and not invited by his manner of treating them. He alſo us'd <hi>Fieſchi</hi> but courſly, which provok'd him in ſuch a manner, that he was ſo far from ſeeking his Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip by the ordinary ſervilities, that he rather indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly betray'd ſome ſigns of his evil-will: and to ſhew that he ſtood in no need of him in that very par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular which made him ſo Famous, he bought the four Gallies of the Duke of <hi>Piacenza</hi> to the infinite vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Giannettin.</hi> In the mean while <hi>Triultio</hi> would not by omitting his diligences corrupt the hopes he had conceiv'd of gaining <hi>Gio. Luigi;</hi> and knowing that in important Reſolutions the nature of Youth muſt be taken warm, that the heat of his paſt Negotiation might not cool, he ſent <hi>Nicolo Foderato,</hi> a Kinſman of the Earls, to <hi>Genoua.</hi> He, by renewing the Treaty and inlarging the Cardinals Promiſes, drew <hi>Gio. Luigi</hi> at laſt to an expreſs declaration of his readineſs to aſſiſt the <hi>French</hi> Army in reducing <hi>Genoua</hi> to the Kings Obedience, upon ſome Conditions favourable to his own greatneſs. The Earl now puts his deſign to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation; and three Perſons there were which he call'd to it; <hi>Vincenza Calcagno,</hi> an old and faithful Servant of his; <hi>Raphael Sacco,</hi> his Lawyer; and <hi>Gio. Battiſta Verrina,</hi> a Citizen of <hi>Genoua.</hi> This laſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a near Neighbour of <hi>Fieſchi's</hi> eaſily obtaind his acquaintance, and by the Earls Liberality ſuſtain'd his declining Fortunes: and had inſinuated himſelf into a participation of his greateſt Secrets. He was of a vaſt Spirit, and bent to the greateſt Exploits: an implacable enemy of the Nobility, as well through Faction as for particular Injuries. Nor could he be content with the preſent Government, which being in
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:62940:105"/>the hands of the Nobility, excluded him from all hopes of ſharing in it. Add to this his ſlender For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes clog'd with Debts, a powerful ſpur to Senſitive minds, which puts them upon a deſperate imbracing any ſtrange deſign, as well by conſideration of their preſent wants, as the memory of their paſt abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance. <hi>Verrina</hi> then perceiving he could no longer conceal his broken Fortunes in the ſerenity of a publick Peace, deſired to hide them in the univerſal confuſion of his Countrey. For if the deſigned wickedneſs were accompanied with Fortune, he ſhould marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly better his condition: and if it were fatal, he ſhould miſcarry, be ruin'd in the common ruine, and expire in the heat of a great Enterprize, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted himſelf with the famous infamy of having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for his Name. So mad a thing is Ambition, which makes no difference in Fame, whether good or evil, ſo it be Great. On the other ſide <hi>Calcagno,</hi> one of a ripe Judgment, but a timorous nature, being us'd to the delights and eaſe of a plentiful Houſe, hated to think of thoſe dangers into which he ſaw <hi>Gio. Luigi</hi> about to precipitate himſelf: Beſides, that ſincerely loving the Perſon rather than the Fortunes of the Earl, in whoſe Service he had grown up from a Child, he had no Intereſt of his own which he deſir'd ſhould flouriſh at the expence of his Maſter. <hi>Sacco</hi> ſeeing the matter every way dangerous ſtood Neuter, not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring his Sentiments, that he might accommodate himſelf opportunely to that Reſolution which ſhould be imbraced by the Earl. <hi>Gio. Luigi</hi> now lays open his mind, with a ſhort, but vehement Speech, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, That he was abſolutely reſolv'd to attempt ſome great matter, and that he ask'd their Advice only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the manner. Notwithſtanding which, <hi>Calcagno</hi> bearing himſelf upon the tender love he bore to his
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:62940:106"/>Maſter, and long Familiarity, with ſingular liberty ſpake to this purpoſe:</p>
            <p>If in your Reſolutions of attempting this deſign you are as obſtinate as your words ſeem to declare, I may rather weep over the Common miſery, than hope to effect any thing by contradicting you. But if prudence and your better Fortune have left place for Second thoughts, which are wont to be moſt matur'd, you ſhall this day have proof of my fidelity in freely ſpeaking to you, as you have hitherto had in my faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful acting for you. You have hitherto liv'd in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant tenour of happineſs, and have not ſeen the threatning face of Fortune: ſo that according to the manner of the Fortunate, you dream of nothing but Victory, increaſe of State and Lordſhips. But I fear much, that theſe gay Figures which revel in your Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, will be defac'd by ſome diſaſtrous event; which will be ſo much the more intolerable, by how much the leſs 'tis fear'd. To introduce a change in the Government of this Commonwealth is a work of ſo much difficulty, and expos'd to ſuch evident danger, that I cannot do ſo much violence to my own thoughts, as to fancy it ſecure and eaſie. For you either deſign to value your ſelf upon the Forces of Strangers, or you hold Intelligence with the Citizens. I ſee no Forein Forces ready; and if they were, they can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be ſo ſpeedy or ſo ſecret, but it may come to the notice of the City, <hi>Doria</hi> and <hi>Caeſar. Italy,</hi> for our Misfortune, is at preſent the Stage of ſuch important Actions as keep open all mens eyes: and <hi>Genoua</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the only Frontier of this Province, is the more jealouſly look'd to. The State of <hi>Millan</hi> (both the Field of Battel, and the deſtin'd prey to the Fortune of the <hi>Imperial</hi> or <hi>French</hi> Arms) cauſes <hi>Caeſar</hi> to watch over <hi>Genoua</hi> as the Bulwark of his Power in
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:62940:106"/>
               <hi>Italy. Doria</hi> aſſiſts him with twenty Gallies; and the Citizens hating the tyranny of the Duke of <hi>Millan</hi> and King of <hi>France,</hi> loath the name of Foreiners. You may indeed with a ſmall Force diſcover your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, but not bring it to effect; and whence you ſhould hope great I cannot imagine. The King of <hi>France</hi> hath enough to do to ſecure his own Frontiers; or if he ſhould aſſiſt you, will not <hi>Caeſar</hi> oppoſe him with Superiour, or not unequal Force? In ſuch a caſe at leaſt the uncertainty of the event will take place, which depends on the doubtful ſucceſs of a Battel. After which you will be forc'd to accommodate your ſelf to that Fortune which ſhall be preſcrib'd you by the Conquerour; and nothing remain with you but the infamy of having ungratefully depriv'd your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey of its liberty, and put it under the yoke of Strangers. If you expect aſſiſtance within the Town, either I do not know the nature and condition of the <hi>Genoueſes,</hi> or you have a ſlippery foundation for your hopes. Tell me, from what order of Citizens you attend Succours; perhaps from the Nobility: But they are the Creatures of <hi>Doria,</hi> and bound to him by notable Intcreſt. They live in an honourable Peace, and poſſeſs the Command of the Commonwealth: ſo that if the leaſt mutation will endammage their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, how can you expect they conſent to a turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Revolution, which muſt caſt them into worſe Calamities than the paſt? Will they, think you, to pleaſe your will, put in oblivion their Countrey, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, Fortunes, Wives and Children? Will they, for your Friendſhip, ſlight the Protection of <hi>Doria,</hi> now reverenc'd as their Father by ſo many particular and common Titles? Nor can you make better Judgment of the Common peoples inclination towards you. For, the greater the hatred is they profeſs to
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:62940:107"/>the name of the Nobility, the leſs can they hope that you, one of the chief in that Order, will without any appearance of reaſon endeavour to extinguiſh it. But if you deſign to compaſs to your ſelf the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Commonwealth, what Action leſs po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular than this, or more unlike to gain the People? But perhaps you pretend to reſtore the firſt Form of Government chang'd by the violence of <hi>Doria,</hi> in which flouriſh'd the popular Power, and by declaring ſo much you think to ſtir up the People in your favour: nor am I obſtinate in believing the contrary, but rather imagine thoſe who are at preſent ill-ſatisfied, will greedily imbrace an occaſion of renewing the paſt Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedies. To which they will be more eaſily mov'd, whilſt they ſhall reap the profit, and you the infamy of the Action: unleſs you can perſwade your ſelf, that the <hi>Adorni</hi> and <hi>Fregoſi</hi> will yield to you that prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence in the popular adminiſtration, which they have ſo long and ſo often ſought for themſelves. They will praiſe your raſhneſs, and call it Valour: they will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low your Enſigns as their Deliverer: they will be glad to ſee the Nobility cruſh'd by a Noble man; the bowels of the Commonwealth wounded by your Arms; the Common Peace overwhelm'd by your Fury; their Tyranny reſtor'd by your Folly; and keeping aloof from the wickedneſs you ſet on foot, (let every thing be call'd by its right name) they will take their time to enter upon the harveſt of your Labours; to ſhare in the honour of your Attempts, in the triumph of your Combats. In what condition ſhall you then find your ſelf? odious to the Nobility you have betray'd; ſcorn'd by the Commonalty, who enjoy the fruits of your Artifices; hated by your Countrey, which through your means hath loſt its Liberty; an Enemy to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> under whoſe protection we are; not truſted by the
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:62940:107"/>King of <hi>France,</hi> who aim'd at the abſolute Command of <hi>Genoua;</hi> abhorr'd by the whole World, which juſtly deteſts all Treaſons. And further I muſt tell you, and 'tis neceſſary you hear it; for the fidelity I owe to your Service, and the love I bear your Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, makes me thus bold: I fear (and God grant my Fears be vain) I fear I ſay, that theſe unquiet and tumultuous Thoughts are the inſtigations of your e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Fortune, which hath deſtin'd you to the loſs of Reputation, Life and Eſtate. You know that <hi>Doria</hi> looks upon you with an envious Eye; and you have complain'd to me, that you dread his Malice; Why then will you put Arms into his hand, wherewith he may juſtly oppreſs you? With how much eagerneſs will he incounter an occaſion to ſatisfie his Hatred to you, under pretence of Love to his Countrey? He will ſecretly be glad of that reſolution which thruſts you forward; and openly taking Arms, with what reaſons may he not juſtifie to the World his oppoſing you? You ſhall be the Enemy of the publick Peace, the Tyrant of publick Liberty, the Betrayer of your Countrey, a Rebel to the Commonwealth, the <hi>Cati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line</hi> of <hi>Genoua.</hi> With theſe magnificent and plauſible words, who amongſt the Commonalty, Nobility, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens; what Stanger, what Private man, what Prince will not Arm himſelf againſt you? I am aſtoniſh'd to think, much more to ſpeak of it. At laſt, you ſhall remain oppreſt by a Common force conſpiring your deſtruction. Your Lands confiſcate, as thoſe of a Traytor; your memory ſtain'd and diſhonour'd in the Annals of <hi>Genoua;</hi> and <hi>Giannettin</hi> acknowledg'd the Second Deliverer of his Countrey and Reſtorer of Liberty, will build his Glories upon your ruines. The gratitude of the <hi>Genoueſes</hi> will raiſe up a Statue to him, to accompay that of <hi>Andrea,</hi> in whoſe Inſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:62940:108"/>ſhall be inſerted the Name of <hi>Gio. Luigi Fieſchi</hi> the publick Enemy, o'rethrown by <hi>Giannettin Doria</hi> the publick Benefactour. Do not then ſuffer your ſelf to be hurried by the impetuouſneſs of your Youth, or reſentments to ſuch dangerous Attempts. Be content to be reſtrain'd by a pity to your Self, Family, and Subjects. Compaſſionate the infelicity of your Mother and Wife. Deliver thoſe that love you from ſo juſt and neceſſary Fears. This your Youth accompanied with ſo much worth, does not deſerve to be prodigally caſt into the hands of Fortune: Enjoy, enjoy thoſe Riches, which in ſuch abundance your Father left you; for you are plac'd in a degree every way ſo eminent, that you may live envy'd by <hi>Giannettin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe words were not heard by <hi>Fieſchi</hi> without ſome trouble of mind; for having receiv'd other proofs of the tender affection of <hi>Calcagno,</hi> he ſaw it now accompanied with ſo many and ſo powerful Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, that he remain'd not a little alter'd; which <hi>Verrina</hi> obſerving, and conſidering, that if he let his Thoughts gather force, all was in danger; handſomly, but with a deteſtable Impiety, he thus oppos'd <hi>Calcag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi>'s Arguments:</p>
            <p>I would to God that the Affairs of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth were reduc'd to ſuch terms, that the Citizens might quietly enjoy their own; you could not then wiſh your ſelf in a better condition: for as <hi>Calcagno</hi> hath well conſider'd, for largeneſs of Territory, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of Birth, and for Riches you have not your equal in <hi>Genoua:</hi> nor ought a Wiſe man in the height of his felicity to provoke his Fortune, which cannot ſuffer change but for the worſe. But Deſtiny, the Enemy of your welfare, hath ſo intangled matters, that you muſt attempt great things, or periſh. <hi>Giannettin Doria,</hi> who for ſo many years hath deſtin'd to his Covetouſneſs
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:62940:108"/>the Command of <hi>Genoua,</hi> will never endure you. If you do not plainly read in his Forehead the implacable Hatred he bears you; if in his Behaviour you do not diſcover his Pride, the Gallies bought by you ſpeak loud enough, that you are a Thorn in his ſide. That Inſolent man does ambition the free and abſolute Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of theſe Seas, nor will he endure that any body ſhould dare to diſturb or divide it with him. How can you imagine he will long ſuffer you to ſhare with him in that Power, when the Jealouſie of Rule does not ſpare the Blood of Brothers, Sons, or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents? Either you muſt then by a ſhameful flight re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire to your Caſtles, and leaving your Gallies leave the Field; or elſe you muſt awaken that Courage which ſhall be ſufficient to oppoſe him. If you reſolve to redeem your ſelf from the approaching danger with your Infamy, and lead your life as receiv'd in gift from him, go, I will not ſtop you: a more wretched condition the hate of <hi>Giannettin</hi> could not wiſh you. But your Vertue bids me hope ſomething more generous, and that I ſhall ſee the vain Pride of that raſh man broken by your Valour. You are then to embrace ſuch an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize as <hi>Giannettin</hi> himſelf ſhall envy. Fortune hath plac'd between you two the Empire of <hi>Liguria,</hi> nor can one of you attain it without making way for the wheels of his Triumph over the breaſt of the other. He can beſt ſecure himſelf of Victory, that knows how by prevention to cut off his Enemies way. the neceſſity of ſecuring your own ſafety is common to both; he will appear wiſeſt, who by the celerity of a reſolute execution ſhall be beforehand with tardy and immature Counſels. Either aſſault, or expect to be aſſaulted. Either prevent him, or fall into his Nets; or kill, or die. Perhaps my words may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear too ſharp; but Neceſſity, which in deſperate
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:62940:109"/>caſes is the Whetſtone of Fortitude, is likewiſe the Shield of Innocence. Let the folly of <hi>Giannettiu</hi> be accus'd; the Cowardice of your Countrey and the iniquity of Fortune, which have reduc'd you to ſuch inevitable ſtraits. You are not injurious to any, whilſt to defend your ſelf you follow the order of Nature. It is part of prudence to divert that Tempeſt upon the head of our Enemy, which threatens our own; and if this cannot be done without appearance of evil, it is not your fault, but Deſtiny's, which left no way to maintain your life but anothers death; and grants no other defence for your Vertue, than Vice. But why do I ſay Vice? this is your word <hi>Calcagno,</hi> and you have learn'd it in the School of the Vulgar, Strangers to the doctrine of Rule. The Actions of Private perſons are ſtyl'd by this name, not the Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes of Princes. If your Rule were right, all Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire ſhould be wicked: for it all proceeds from the force of the ſtronger over the weaker. Nature pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd Mankind in a perfect equality, and left it to Vertue to attain Supremacy. Whence thoſe are call'd Princes, who by their Wit and Force knew how to compaſs a Command over others. I deny not but ſome will joyn with <hi>Calcagno</hi> to chide your Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before it be conducted to its end: for dangerous and bold Actions are not celebrated till they have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd their effect; but when the Fortune of the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution ſhall have authenticated the nobleneſs of the Attempt, that blaming ſhall be converted into won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and what was firſt call'd Raſhneſs ſhall be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'd with the Title of Valour. Whilſt <hi>Caeſar</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf had his Arms in his hand, and fought for the Empire of <hi>Rome,</hi> not only <hi>Pompey,</hi> but the greateſt part of the Nobility obſtinately oppos'd him; but when he had overthrown his Enemy in the <hi>Pharſalian</hi>
               <pb n="215" facs="tcp:62940:109"/>Field, and maſter'd the Commonwealth, Civil hatred ceas'd, and he was ſo ſincerely belov'd by the <hi>Romans,</hi> that they ſeverely reveng'd his death. Let the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noueſes</hi> for a time call you Tyrant, and don't think that Name injurious, but imagine only that dying Liberty talks idly. They will by degrees be brought to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge you a legitimate Prince. You ſee how I confide in your Fortunes, deſigning you Empire before you are prepar'd to fight for it. But ſuch is the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of Affairs, that you may rather be wanting to your ſelf, than Empire to you. For if the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are great in the opinion of <hi>Calcagno,</hi> you have Force enough to maſter greater. And grant that 'tis a hard and knotty Enterprize; what Famous Action do you meet with in Ancient or Modern ſtory, that was conducted by ſmooth and flowry ways? Great Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes were ever accompanied with great Dangers, and the greateſt heights confine upon Precipices. A man of elevated thoughts will not for all that let an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain fear of eminent Calamity deliver him a prey to certain Miſery. In a Private condition 'tis prudent Counſel to ſtick to Mediocrities, but in occurrences of State middle ways are moſt pernicious; eſpecially when the buſineſs muſt begin at execution: For not being able to put bounds to things that are once a foot, and out of our hands, we muſt reach our propoſed ends, or fall into ruine. But let us not give to our Affairs ſuch unhappy Auguries. Let us take a view of Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes by a neceſſary foreſight, not to torment our ſelves in the expectation, but to prevent their bad effects by prudence; let us walk warily, but let not too much Caution render us fearful and irreſolute. Let ſomething be left to the diſpoſal of your Fortune; and Fate, who having choſen you for <hi>Genoua's</hi> Deliverer, and Reſtorer of the Ancient <hi>Italian</hi> Valour, will find
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:62940:110"/>ways to unravel all difficulties; only conſent to be Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute, and imbrace with largeneſs of heart thoſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours which Fortune freely pours into your boſom, without dividing them. To what end ſhould you call the <hi>French</hi> to ſhare in your Fortunes, who having loſt what they poſſeſt on this ſide the Mountains, together with their Reputation, are not ſecure of <hi>Caeſar</hi> in their own Territories? Beſides, you ought to conſider the natural Hatred that Nation bears to the <hi>Italian</hi> Name. That King, 'tis true, is indu'd with Qualities truly Royal, but for all that he hath his weakneſſes, inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable from great Princes. And what Recompence can the <hi>French</hi> give you worthy of your pains and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers? perhaps leave you in the Government of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noua,</hi> with dependance upon them? But this were to make your ſelf mercenary in that Countrey, where Nature hath inveſted you with part of the Principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity: 'tis better you value your ſelf on your own Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, Friends, and Confederates; and not let that Crown be put on your Head by others hands, which is ſo worthy of you, and you of it. When you ſhall have eſtabliſh'd your Power in <hi>Genoua,</hi> and thereby keep even the Key of <hi>Italy,</hi> the beſt Princes of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom will ambitiouſly court your Friendſhip. Then, when you ſhall have overcome the envy of Competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, your Family ſhall be plac'd in a height to which none of <hi>Genoua</hi> hath attain'd. <hi>Giannettin</hi> ſhall fall at your feet, reverence you as his Lord, and fear you as his Prince; with a beck you ſhall regulate his Actions, and your will ſhall give Law to his deſires. Let the <hi>French</hi> alone then in their Countrey, and there let them hear the ſound of your Victories. To you it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs now vigorouſly to incounter what ſtands in the way of your deſign. Do it with a Reſolution worthy of your Birth and Courage. Deſerve that Triumph
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:62940:110"/>which the Heavens have deſtin'd you. Let the World ſee you know how to build your own Fortunes. Let my mighty Hopes be ſurmounted by your Vertue. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a Kingdom to your Family, and eternity to your Name.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gio. Luigi</hi> had never apply'd his mind to get <hi>Genoua</hi> for himſelf, but for the Crown of <hi>France;</hi> contented to leſſen the exceſſive Power of <hi>Doria,</hi> and to better his own condition under the Kings protection: but being covetous of Fame, and in his nature inclin'd to vaſt Pretences, 'twas eaſie for <hi>Verrina</hi> to take him off from the <hi>French,</hi> and put him upon his own Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement. So that no longer weighing the Reaſons of <hi>Calcagno,</hi> he was as it were fatally carried to the execution of the moſt dangerous, and leaſt honeſt Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. But for all this he was much perplexed with an apprehenſion of the difficulties wanting the <hi>French</hi> aſſiſtance. In which doubt <hi>Raphael Sacco</hi> confirm'd him, who being of the <hi>French</hi> Faction prais'd the Conditions offer'd by <hi>Triultio,</hi> as fit to be imbrac'd. But <hi>Verrina</hi> deteſting all mixtures as dangerous in a buſineſs which call'd for extream Reſolutions, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd by all ways to remove this obſtacle which cool'd the fervency of <hi>Gio. Luigi.</hi> So he replies with much vehemency, That 'twas a meanneſs unworthy a Noble mind to be frighted off a deſign with Phantaſms. That in the Garriſon of <hi>Genoua</hi> were no more than two hundred Souldiers; <hi>Doria's</hi> Gallies though many in number remain'd uſeleſs, for by reaſon of the Seaſon improper for Navigation they were diſarm'd; <hi>Andrea</hi> and <hi>Giannettin</hi> far from all ſuſpicion of Violence, liv'd abandon'd without Guard publick or private; <hi>Gio. Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>igi</hi> might in an inſtant bring in a good number of Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers from the neighbouring Caſtles, which ſhould ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize the <hi>Doria's</hi> in their Houſe; at the ſame time
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:62940:111"/>'twould be eaſie to maſter the Gallies: the reſt would happily fall in of it ſelf, through the inveterate hatred the Common people bore the Nobility: He offer'd himſelf to ſtir up the Commonalty in favour of the Enterprize, whoſe minds he had by his endeavours already well diſpos'd. Theſe, and other particulars urg'd by <hi>Verrina</hi> with great ſubtlety, eſpecially a ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority of Genius which he had over <hi>Gio. Luigi,</hi> gave the laſt ſhock to his wavering mind. So now ſully deſcending into the opinion of <hi>Verrina,</hi> he began to conſider how he might proceed to carry the deſign proſperouſly. The firſt and joynt Reſolution of them all was, that ſeeing the ſafety of the <hi>Doria's</hi> was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparably link'd to the preſent Government, to change this 'twas neceſſary to take thoſe out of the way: and, to be ſecure in their Revenge, to kill likewiſe <hi>Adamo Conturione,</hi> Father in Law to <hi>Giannettin,</hi> and ſome others of the Nobility.</p>
            <p>From the firſt day that <hi>Gio. Luigi</hi> gave way to theſe thoughts, after he had bought the Gallies he retir'd to his Caſtles, where he was wont to exerciſe the Militia of the Countrey, pretending to fear the Duke of <hi>Pia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenza</hi> his Neighbour; but really with intention of fitting his Subjects, that they might become propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable Inſtruments to his deſigns. Returning to the City at the beginning of Autumn, he us'd great Art to purchaſe the Friendſhip of thoſe among the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, which were ſtyl'd Popular. He inſinuates him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into their Converſation with wondrous facility: to ſome he gave; others he aſſiſted in their occurring Intereſts; to every one he offer'd himſelf with great demonſtrations of Courteſie. And being of a lively Wit and a bending Nature, 'tis ſcarce credible how fortunately he gain'd their confidence. When he ſaw that he had maſter'd their wills, he began as occaſion
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:62940:111"/>offer'd, to mock at the Tyranny of the Nobility, as he call'd it; at another time he would ſeem, by abrupt diſcourſes, to pity the condition of the Common people, ſometimes he would hint, that there was a way to ſuppreſs the Arrogance of the Nobility, if they were not wanting to themſelves; ſometimes exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them by a bitter Irony to patience, and ever with perplexed words leaving ſome ſting in their minds. But above all, exaggerating the iniquity of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if by chance any thing fell out diſpleaſing to the Common people. Nor did he omit his diligences e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with the dregs of the Commonalty; ready in his Salutations; pleaſant in encounter; ſplendid in his Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit; Courteous to all. In this Nature helped him not a little, being of exquiſite Form, in the flower of his Youth, and of a Jovial complexion; whence by a ſweetneſs of air in his Face, and an elegant Behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, he was belov'd even at firſt ſight, and verified in himſelf what was ſaid of <hi>Abſalon.</hi> Beſides, he fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently exercis'd Horſemanſhip, and did it with infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite grace and becomingneſs. But becauſe an opinion of Liberality is the ſtrongeſt Chain to bind the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, 'tis ſaid, that he one day call'd to him the Conſul of the <hi>Silk-weavers,</hi> of which Trade there are a great number in <hi>Genoua,</hi> familiarly asking him the condition of his Company; and underſtanding that they liv'd in great miſery by reaſon of the badneſs of Trade, he ſhew'd ſigns of a moſt tender Compaſſion toward the Poor men, and ſaid, they were not to be abandon'd in a time of ſo much need; he therefore orders him to ſend ſecretly to his Houſe ſuch whoſe neceſſity was moſt manifeſt and urgent. The next day comes a great number of them one by one, and he as one of ſingular Charity, divides amongſt them a certain quantity of Corn; telling them withal, that it being
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:62940:112"/>the Ancient Cuſtome of his Family to relieve neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous and afflicted Perſons, he could not degenerate from his Anceſtours, therefore when they wanted Means to ſuſtain their Families, they might confidently value themſelves on his Subſtance, which they ſhould always find expos'd to their Relief, provided they were ſilent; Secreſie being a main circumſtance in Alms. They departed no leſs comforted by the Relief, than amaz'd at the Liberality, reputing their Benefactour worthy of all good Fortune. He in the mean time would not in ſuch a manner caſt himſelf into the arms of the Commonalty as to fall into Jealouſies of the Nobility; but ſtudied to uſe ſuch a temperament, that the confidence of the one ſhould not deſtroy the Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the other. Wherefore he betook himſelf to a profound Simulation, and began to frequent <hi>Doria's</hi> Palace more than before: and diſſembling well the mortal hatred he bore <hi>Giannettin,</hi> behav'd himſelf with all Familiarity, craving his Advice and aſſiſtance in all his Affairs. In the mean while he correſponded with the Duke of <hi>Piacenza,</hi> who promis'd him two thouſand Foot to joyn with what Force he could raiſe in his own State. He likewiſe cauſes one of his Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies to come to <hi>Genoua,</hi> pretending to ſend it for the <hi>Barbary</hi> ſhore. Nor was <hi>Verrina</hi> idle all this while, but cunningly gain'd divers perſons to promiſe him their aid in a certain occaſion. With theſe Preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons they thought a ſufficient foundation was laid for the building up of their deſign, and met once more to conſult of the execution. The firſt opinion was, that they ſhould intimate a new Maſs in the Church of St. <hi>Andrea,</hi> to which <hi>Andrea, Giannettin,</hi> and ſome of the principal Nobility, whoſe lives they deſign'd upon, ſhould be invited. But this ſeem'd no leſs wioked than unſafe; for <hi>Andrea</hi> would have excus'd himſelf
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:62940:112"/>by his Age: Beſides, it ſeem'd too horrid to give be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to their deſign with the Sacrilegious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaning of a Temple and Sacrifice. But becauſe the Reins once let looſe we are hurried precipitouſly to all ſorts of wickedneſs, though ſhame gave check to the laſt determination, it broke out afterwards in a moſt deteſtable Impiety. For upon occaſion of a Marriage to be celebrated between a Siſter of <hi>Giannettins</hi> and <hi>Guilio Gabo,</hi> Marqueſs of <hi>Maſſa,</hi> and Kinſman of <hi>Gio. Luigi,</hi> they reſolv'd that the Earl ſhould invite the <hi>Doria's,</hi> and thoſe of the Nobility which they thought ſtood moſt in the way, to Supper with the Brides Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; and that all of them (violating the right of Hoſpitality) ſhould be murther'd by certain Men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd in the Houſe for that purpoſe; and that the Earl ſhould immediately iſſue out with his Followers, and call the people to Liberty; and that at the Palace <hi>Verrina,</hi> by a plauſible Speech ſhewing the neceſſity of reforming the Government, ſhould prepare the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons to accept of <hi>Gio. Luigi</hi> for their Prince. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon order was given, that from <hi>Gio. Luigi</hi>'s Caſtle ſhould enter into the City one by one the beſt of his Souldiers, and the Duke of <hi>Piacenza</hi> was ſolicited to ſend his promis'd Succours. Theſe diligences, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of liſting Souldiers, could not paſs ſo ſecretly but the Governour of <hi>Millan</hi> had ſome notice of it, and ſent to <hi>Genoua</hi> to give it <hi>Doria</hi> and the Emperours Embaſſadour. <hi>Andrea</hi> notwithſtanding, deceiv'd by thoſe flattering demonſtrations of affection, and that ſerenity of Countenance which he continually found in <hi>Gio. Luigi,</hi> was a ſecond time incredulous to thoſe pregnant Circumſtances which lay againſt him. Nor did he change opinion, when the ſame Government of <hi>Millan</hi> having a confirmation of it from the Court of <hi>France,</hi> advis'd him once more ſeriouſly to take it
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:62940:113"/>into conſideration. And certainly, if we did not read of ſeveral Great perſons, who have been hardly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to give credit to what they heard was plotting againſt their ſafety, the ſimplicity of <hi>Andrea</hi> were ſharply to be blam'd; who in a matter that concern'd his life, and the ſafety of the Commonwealth, lent more belief to the diſſembling looks of <hi>Gio. Luigi,</hi> than to the thing it ſelf; as if it were an unuſual thing to put on a Face to ſerve the Scene; or as if for the ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard of our Countrey and Life any kind of Vigilance were ſuperfluous. But ſeeing the Stories of all times do furniſh a hundred Examples of prudent men, who have ſuffer'd themſelves to be bewitch'd by this fatal Incredulity in things of the greateſt importance, we muſt needs ſay, that the Accidents order'd or inevitably permitted by the Providence that governs them, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire to bring them to effect this momentany Folly in the brighteſt Intellects, as the aſſault of a violent fit in the moſt healthful Bodies, to mortifie Worldly wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which in Affairs of greateſt weight appears light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt. More quick-ſighted was <hi>Paolo Panſa,</hi> who with a loving as well as a prudent Eye, ſtudying the Actions of <hi>Gio. Luigi</hi> from the time that he bought the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, did much ſuſpect ſome important Action depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and by the Authority which his condition gave him, reprov'd him. After that, weighing exactly what he heard and ſaw, he found occaſion to augment his conceiv'd ſuſpicion. For <hi>Gio. Luigi,</hi> who was wont before to impart to him his moſt ſecret Affairs was now ſilent, and withdrew often to private Conſultations with others. And though riding about the City, or in converſation with his Friends, he marvellouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd his inward thoughts; yet when he came home he was chang'd into another man, full of profound thoughtfulneſs, and little leſs than aſtoniſh'd. Nor
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:62940:113"/>did he hide his deſigns from <hi>Panſa</hi> for any other reaſon, but becauſe knowing him a Man of ſingular integrity, he concluded that he would by all means endeavour to divert him: or at leaſt, as one that was a Stranger to Military noiſes, and educated in the pleaſing idleneſs of the Muſes, examining every Circumſtance with too much Caution, he would meaſure the Enterprize by terms of ſecurity, impoſſible to be had in ſuch caſes. One day <hi>Gio. Luigi</hi> coming home more than ordinarily Melancholy, by an unquiet motion and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain countenance gave ſigns of ſome great altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; ſo that <hi>Panſa</hi> reſolv'd to ſpeak to him, leſt by deferring it, the Remedy might come when the Diſeaſe was paſt cure; and withdrawing into a Chamber with him, he thus began:</p>
            <p>To pry into anothers Secrets is as unworthy a gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant man, as the faithful keeping of them, when de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſited, is laudable; and I, who would have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd this, if it were not known to you by ſo many proofs, have abſtain'd from that, not to do a thing that might diſpleaſe you. Your unwonted Silence ſpeaks to me notwithſtanding loud enough, and ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies Matters of ſo much the more weight, as they are deeply conceal'd. I read in your diſturb'd Face the neceſſity of my Cares, and I learn from your Fears to fear. I fear <hi>Gio. Luigi,</hi> I fear, nor do I know what: I know well, that this is the fervency of the Love I bear you, and one of the Raptures of my Fidelity. And how can I perſwade my ſelf that your mind is bent upon a fitting Subject, when it hath the power to diſturb its ſerenity? The execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your deſign cannot be peaceable, when the bare thought of it works ſuch a change in you: and you give too unhappy augury of that Enterprize, which you commence with inquietudes. To what end do
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:62940:114"/>thoſe Counſels tend, which leave you floating in a thouſand perplexing Cares? Theſe ſecret Aſſemblings of men Violent and Crafty, I fear much, will lead you aſtray from the path of Honeſty, (Suffer me to han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle the Wound in order to its cure,) they are not of ſo Innocent life, or ſuch ſincere Piety, that I dare pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe my ſelf from them an honeſt and religious Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. Perhaps they abuſe your Years, and finding you generous, propound Actions in appearance Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, but indeed raſh. Open your eyes <hi>Gio. Luigi,</hi> for one fool may thruſt you down that Precipice, from which the arts of a thouſand Wiſe men ſhall not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover you. 'Tis eaſie to ſet a Houſe on fire, but with how much ſweat, and after how much dammage is it extinguiſh'd? Look to it, that they do not uſe you as the way to their end, or that your loſs does not profit thoſe that deceive you. Thoſe Counſellors are too rarely found, which aim at what is right ſeparate from Intereſt; and yet by this Touchſtone you ought to try them. I cannot believe, that he who leads his life amidſt a thouſand Debaucheries, will invite ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Vertue: for though what he ſaith contradicts what he does, yet the principal part of perſwaſion lies in the Example, not in the Tongue; at leaſt the Mouth and Hand muſt go together. What do they deſire of you? what Novelty would they have you attempt? Your condition hath no need of motion to change it. That Fortune, ſo propitious to your Houſe, may be eaſily provok'd. The leaſt alteration which can ſucceed muſt be worſe than your preſent ſtate. Envy hath long ſought to enter amidſt your happineſs, and will ſoon get in, if you put it in diſorder: for many of thoſe which are Inferiour to you for Birth and Place, go in queſt of occaſions to traduce you. Youth hath not a ſweeter food than
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:62940:114"/>Hope, 'tis true; but 'tis as true there is nothing more ſlippery than Proſperity: Look to it then, that by reaching at what you hope for, you do not loſe what you have in your hands. Thoſe who are of your Counſel have nothing to loſe. Tumults, Seditions and Ruines, by which bad Men riſe, make for them: he does not fear to fall that is not plac'd on high. You ought to walk warily, for you are oblig'd to furniſh Fame with matter worthy of your Birth.</p>
            <p>This Diſcourſe was heard by <hi>Gio. Luigi</hi> with impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, for his mind was elſewhere: He anſwer'd him notwithſtanding confuſedly, That he intended nothing but what was Noble and worthy of his Birth, which at convenient time he ſhould underſtand from him. Whilſt the day appointed for the Feaſt, being the fourth of <hi>January,</hi> was expected by the Conſpiratours, there happen'd an Accident which put them on a neceſſity of haſtning the deſign; to their infinite vexation, ſeeing their hopes of ſeizing on a good part of the Nobility at the Creation of a new Duke fruſtrate. For <hi>Andrea</hi> taken with unwonted and exceſſive pains of the Gout could not come according to his Promiſe, and <hi>Giannet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi> was to leave <hi>Genoua</hi> upon ſome urgent Affair; ſo that conſidering a Conſpiracy hath not a greater ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacle than Delay, they reſolv'd to execute it the night of the ſecond of <hi>January.</hi> And now <hi>Gio. Luigi</hi> gives out, that he will ſend abroad one of his Gallies againſt the Pirates. And under this colour he brought in the Souldiers ſent him from <hi>Piacenza,</hi> and ſome of his own Vaſſals, pretending an Election out of them. And to the end that the Number of them which came from his own State, beyond the occaſions of one Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, might not give ſuſpicion, he cauſed ſome of them to be brought in fetter'd, as Criminals deſtin'd to the Ore: others enter'd ſingly at ſeveral Gates, and
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:62940:115"/>Arms were provided for them all. Afterwards, the better to deceive <hi>Giannettin,</hi> under pretext of Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence he imparts his deſign, praying him to interpoſe with <hi>Andrea,</hi> that it might not be impeded; ſeeming to be fearful, that becauſe a Truce was made between the Grand <hi>Signior</hi> and <hi>Caeſar,</hi> he might ſtop the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley. The firſt of <hi>January,</hi> which preceded the Night fatal to <hi>Genoua, Gio. Luigi</hi> call'd home to him certain Souldiers of the City Garriſon, whereof ſome were his own Vaſſals, others had obtain'd their Places by his means; then he goes to <hi>Andrea's</hi> Houſe, where he ſtaid late, ſhewing ſigns of a moſt tender love and reſpect: and meeting with the Children of <hi>Giannettin,</hi> which were playing in the Hall, with a tender and curious flattery, in the ſight of their Father he kiſſes them ſeveral times, and takes them in his arms: At parting he renews his inſtance with <hi>Giannettin,</hi> to take care his Galley, which that Night was to ſet ſail, was not hindred by his Men. And further, he adviſes him not to be ſurpriz'd, if by chance he heard Guns ſhot off, or other noiſe; for a buſineſs of this nature could not be effected without ſome diſturbance. When it began to be dark, he brings into his Houſe thoſe Souldiers he had need of, and ſet ſuch as he eſteem'd moſt Faithful and Valiant at the Gates to admit all that came, but not to ſuffer any go out. He dwelt in the higheſt part of the City, in a place as it were divided from the reſt, which was opportune for his deſign. When the Centinels were to be ſet, he who commanded the Garriſon miſs'd ſome of his Souldiers, and found they were gone to <hi>Gio. Luigi's</hi> Houſe; ſo that ſuſpecting ſome pernicious deſign, he advis'd the Senatours who were at the Palace. And now began to appear the fruit of <hi>Gio. Luigi's</hi> Diſſimulation and Caution: for <hi>Giannettin</hi> poſſeſt with what he had heard concerning
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:62940:115"/>the Galley, ſtifled their growing Fears by telling them, That thoſe Souldiers, or Vaſſals, or Servants of the Earl, were employ'd by him about the Voyage for the Lieutenant. So ſhort ſighted is Humane underſtanding, that then men build up their own Misfortunes, when they think they have put all in ſecurity. <hi>Gio. Luigi,</hi> after he had given neceſſary Orders at home, went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad to viſit the <hi>Vegli's</hi> which the Nobility are wont to keep at their Houſes in Winter Evenings. About four hours in the Night he came to the Houſe of <hi>Toma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo Aſereto,</hi> where <hi>Verrina</hi> had cunningly drawn toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther three and twenty of the young Nobility of the Popular Order. He treats them with much kindneſs, and invites them home with him to Supper; praiſing the ſtilneſs of the Evening, enlightned by a pure ray of the Moon. When he was come home, he carries them into a certain remote Chamber, and orders <hi>Panſa</hi> to entertain his Wife <hi>Leonora</hi> in another Room till he return'd. In the mean while <hi>Verrina</hi> goes up and down to the Palace, to <hi>Doria's</hi> Houſe, and other parts of the City, to ſee if there were any Rumour. The young Gentlemen were not a little aſtoniſh'd to ſee the Houſe full of Arms and Armed men, and look'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one another, when <hi>Gio. Luigi</hi> his Countenance al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together chang'd (whether with horrour of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching Parricide, or with rage againſt <hi>Giannettin,</hi> which hitherto violently ſmother'd in his breaſt, now began to attempt a paſſage through his eyes and mouth) leaning upon a Table, and ſtriking upon it with his hand, he thus deliver'd himſelf:</p>
            <p>So it is gallant Gentlemen. He that hath but one drop of ingenuous Blood cannot ſuffer it. The conſtancy of my Thoughts receives too great a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence from the unworthineſs of thoſe who go about to ruine me. Too ſad a Spectacle is drawn in my mind
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:62940:116"/>by the fear of my falling Countrey, and oppreſs'd Countreymen. If the Evils which mortally afflict the Commonwealth could hope a remedy from Time, I would willingly ſubmit to any delay that might be uſeful to the Common good: but ſeeing our Affairs are arriv'd at their laſt Precipice; 'tis neceſſary we go meet our miſery to ſuſtain it. Dangers generouſly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter'd, loſe their force; patiently expected, gather ſtrength. <hi>Giannettin Doria</hi> fatiated with the idle Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity that purſues him, wearies himſelf in following that Ambition which torments him; and now ready to gather the fruits of his bad deſigns, threatens you with loſs of Liberty, and me of Life. Not content to ſee the People of <hi>Genoua,</hi> who were lately abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Moderators of all <hi>Liguria,</hi> now ſtript of their Dignity, and a ſcorn to the Pride of the Nobility, he dare ſubject it to a Tyrannous Principality, which he is erecting for himſelf. To this effect, not enduring a Private Fortune, become in a Free Countrey more barbarous than Strangers, he arms his heart with ſuch a contumacious Pride as cannot be overcome by Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty, nor ſcap'd by Humility. He keeps, as you ſee, your Sea beſieg'd with twenty Gallies; he paſſes up and down the City ſurrounded with the Nobility, who by <hi>Andrea</hi>'s favour, poſſeſs'd of thoſe Dignities which were yours, render to <hi>Giannettin</hi> a Servile reſpect, as a Reward for his cruſhing the Common People: and that which more afflicts me, I have invincible Proofs, that by the aſſiſtance of a Great Prince he prepares a cruel Yoke for the Publick Liberty. And becauſe I alone being partial, not ſo much to your Order as to Right, have never conſented with the reſt of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to the oppreſſion of the People, my life is aim'd at. Why then do we lie buried in Sloth, my Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men? why do we remain fearful Spectitours of our
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:62940:116"/>own Miſeries? For what Enterprize do we reſerve our Courage, if in the utmoſt deſolation of our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey we unhappily abandon our ſelves? It is no longer time to complain of them, but to be reveng'd upon them; let us leave the Tongue-War to Women, and he that is a Man let him uſe his hands. We have too long born their Inſolence, who call our Modeſty Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardize. The impunity of paſt Crimes is pregnant of new, and too much diſſimulation of the Oppreſſed provokes the minds of Oppreſſours to greater Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. And what do we expect further from them? Having loſt the Government, and all place of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand in the Commonwealth, can you be content to ſee your Goods ſnatch'd from you by <hi>Giannettins</hi> Officers, your Families deſtroy'd, your Lives betray'd, your Wives and Children diſhonour'd, and all thoſe Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanies committed, which may juſtly be fear'd in a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny bred out of the ruine of your Countrey, nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh'd with the Publick hatred, grown up with the Injuries of the Citizens, eſtabliſh'd by the death of Good men? Are our minds ſo low, and our Bloods ſo Spiritleſs? Are our Arms ſo blunt, that we cannot by a Revenging hand cut of their infamous Lives, who honour themſelves with our Diſgraces, triumph in our Misfortunes, and feed on our Miſeries? Shall we not tear from the Breaſt of <hi>Giannettin</hi> his wretched Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els? Shall we not rend that Heart from its fibres, which is the neſt of ſuch enormous Treaſons? Shall we ſuffer a Citizen with an Inſolent foot to trample on us, and to have over us, as over Slaves born to ſerve, the arbitrement of liſe and death? I for my part eſteem a Liberty bought with great Danger more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, than a Servitude flatter'd with Idleneſs: and as I count it my Honour, that the Common Enemy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns to joyn my death with the deſtruction of the
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:62940:117"/>Commonwealth, ſo I willingly conſecrate my life to the conſervation of its Liberty; and I ſhould be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of it, did I prize it above my Countrey. Only I would diſcover in you ſuch a freeneſs of Soul as is, if not worthy of your Vertue, at leaſt correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to your danger. Wherefore either Captain or Souldier, which you will for my part; if you lead, I'le follow; follow me, if I lead. I conſign you my Mind fearleſs in all Accidents, my Body ſhall be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in your hands. But you, whether Honour be dear to you, or whether you deſire to be ſafe, 'tis neceſſary you be Couragious, and betake you to your Arms: for ſuch a Reſolution which as to Valiant men is glorious, as to Cowards is profitable, and every way neceſſary. Nor do I call you to an indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted and raſh deſign; for ſeveral Months ſince I have not only foreſeen, but provided for this hour, by aſſembling ſufficient Forces, which diſtributed in fitting places invite you rather to a Spectacle of certain Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, than to the danger of a doubtful Combat. When you ſhall reduce to your memory the Abuſes of the Nobility, and the Pride of <hi>Giannettin,</hi> I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that awakening in your ſelves the deſire of an honourable Revenge, it will make you ſo bold in the manage of your Arms, that our Enemies to their loſs ſhall be forc'd to admire Valour in thoſe whom they deſpis'd; whilſt you on the contrary ſhall make experience, whether they have ſo much force in feats of War, as ſoftneſs in the encounters of Peace. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long then my Companions, this ſhall be the end of my Speech, and the beginning of your Conqueſt. Let us go out into the City, where we are expected, to put a ſpeedy end to an Enterprize ſo well begun. The Gates are in the power of Souldiers by me corrupted: the Gallies, at a ſign given, will fall into the hands of
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:62940:117"/>ſuch as are bold and able to keep them: In the City fifteen hundred Artizans ready Arm'd expect us: In the Suburbs by this time are arriv'd two thouſand Foot from <hi>Piacenza,</hi> and as many more of my own Souldiers. Let us call the People to Liberty: Let us return to the ſweetneſs of the Ancient Government, and root out the Tyranny of <hi>Giannettin</hi> and the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility. Generouſly, my Companions, in one ſole Night, more bright than a thouſand Days, let us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore to the obſcur'd Name of the Populace its Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſplendour, and cancel all memory of paſt Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardice. But if any of you ſhall be ſo ſtubborn as to think of oppoſing ſo Noble and Pious an Action, let him behold this horrible Scene of Arms and Armed men, and think the point of every Sword is levell'd at his breaſt. I vow, Companions, 'tis neceſſary to fight, or die: That Blood which ungratefully is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd to the ſuccour of the ſuffering Commonwealth, ſhall be ſpilt in this very place to waſh off the ſtain of ſo much perfidiouſneſs; and he as the firſt Victim to be conſecrated this Night to the love of our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, ſhall fall here by my hand, if any dare oppoſe me.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who were preſent ſtartled at this terrible Speech, and frighted to ſee themſelves encompaſs'd on all ſides with Arm'd men, were ſilent awhile; but at laſt, ſway'd more by the fear of the preſent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, than by the horrour of the future wickedneſs, appear'd willing to apply themſelves to the will of <hi>Gio. Luigi.</hi> In the mean while rather a ſhort Colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion than a Supper is brought in; which while they were eating <hi>Gio. Luigi</hi> goes into the Chamber where his Wife <hi>Leonora</hi> was with <hi>Panſa,</hi> and diſcovers to them in a few words what he was about to do. The Lady wonderfully aſtoniſh'd at the wickedneſs of
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:62940:118"/>the Fact joyn'd with the extream peril of her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, all in Tears fell at his feet; By what is moſt dear to you in the World (ſaith ſhe to him) and by that tender Love I bear you, let me beſeech you <hi>Gio. Luigi,</hi> to have a care of your own Life, and do not ſtain the Honour of your Family by ſo unworthy an Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. By theſe my Tears I conjure you, not to forget your ſelf, me, your Countrey, and God. To what Precipice are you haſtning? and me, where do you leave me? Muſt I ſtay here with a trembling heart, expecting the cruel News of your death, and remain a diſconſolate Widow, pointed at by all for having been the Wife of a Traytour? Can you find in your heart to abandon me a prey to the Licence of Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and of the Common people, who flocking hither to ſack this Houſe, as the neſt of a Rebel, ſhall ſatiate their Cruelty, and perhaps their Luſt in this my Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy? Stay <hi>Gio. Luigi</hi>— She could not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, hindred by her Tears, and interrupted by the Earl, who ſeeing <hi>Panſa</hi> prepar'd to ſecond her, cut off all in ſaying, Do not, my Dear Wife; lend ſo bad Omens to my Enterprize, but ſuſtain your mind with better hopes. I go whither I am call'd by my Fate. Prepare your mind for all Events. My Affairs are reduc'd to that point, that I am not at liberty to retire. A few hours will let you know my Death, or your Happineſs: Reſt in peace. And now comes in <hi>Verrina,</hi> and tells them no oppoſition could be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected in any part of the Town, and that the Galley ſtuſt with ſtout Souldiers was ready to ſtop the mouth of the <hi>Darſena,</hi> and as it were to beſiege thoſe of <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now <hi>Gio. Luigi,</hi> Arming thoſe he had aſſembled, goes out at Ten of the Clock at Night, ſending before him an hundred and fifty of his beſt Men. He fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:62940:118"/>accompany'd with the Nobility, taking great care that none of them ſlipt away. Being come to the Town, he ſent <hi>Cornelio</hi> his Natural Brother with a Squadron of Souldiers to poſſeſs themſelves of the Gate <hi>del Arco;</hi> which they did, the Guard conſiſting but of a few, being eaſily oppreſs'd. Heartned by this favourable ſucceſs he goes on, and ſends <hi>Girolamo</hi> and <hi>Ottabruno</hi> his Brothers with <hi>Calcagno</hi> to ſeize on the Gate of St. <hi>Tomaſo:</hi> but himſelf hearing the ſign from the Galleys, haſtens to the Bridge <hi>de Catani,</hi> and finds his way made for him by <hi>Borgognini,</hi> who had by Water got into the <hi>Darſena.</hi> And now 'twas not difficult for him to enter <hi>Doria's</hi> Galley. The Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners and Slaves awakened by the unexpected Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of Arm'd men in the Port, did wound the Air with a confus'd and horrible noiſe of Chains and Voices, crying <hi>Liberty.</hi> The Slaves all ſtriving to break their odious Fetters. But <hi>Gio. Luigi,</hi> whoſe intentions and occaſions could not be ſerv'd by naked Galleys, to hinder the dammage which might reſult from their eſcape, ran haſtily toward the <hi>Captain,</hi> and getting upon a Plank which was laid to paſs from the Poop to the ſhore, the Galley having ſome ſmall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he fell together with the Plank into the Water; being Arm'd at all points, he could not help himſelf by Swimming; and by reaſon of the noiſe of the Tumult, and the darkneſs of the Night, he was not ſeen nor heard of any body, but miſerably periſh'd rather in a puddle of Muddy water, than in the Sea, oppreſs'd by thoſe very Arms to which he had truſted the ſafety of his life. Thus the unerring Providence of God ſports with the fooliſh prudence of unhappy Mortals, and by a light and caſual motion, like the Stone cut out of the Mountain in an inſtant, deſtroy'd the proud Machine of a Conſpiracy, which had been
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:62940:119"/>long building with a great deal of Artifice, and ſecur'd by ſo much Force: driving back upon the heads of the guilty thoſe Thunderbolts, which they barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly darted at the boſom of their miſerable Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and ſo many innocent Citizens. For all this the Galley was taken and ſecur'd by the Conſpiratours. Nor was <hi>Girolamo</hi> and <hi>Ottabruno</hi> wanting to their charge; for hearing the Gun ſhot off, as was agreed, they affaulted the Gate St. <hi>Tomaſo</hi> with ſixty Souldiers, not only to reduce it into their hands, but to paſs by it to the Palace of <hi>Doria,</hi> which ſtood a little without the City. Here they found ſome reſiſtance, but in a ſhort time became Maſters of the Gate. The noiſe in the <hi>Darſena</hi> was heard to <hi>Doria's</hi> Palace. And <hi>Giannettin</hi> riſing from his Bed, thinking ſome quarrel might have hapned aboard the Galley at Play, or by ſome other Accident, rapt by his Deſtiny to encounter death, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company'd with one Servant and a Page, goes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Gate, which he believ'd was kept by the wonted Guard, and with his uſual fierceneſs increas'd then by his anger, he calls to have it open'd. The Voice being known by the Conſpiratours they readily open'd it; but he was ſcarce ſtep'd in, when with a tempeſt of Blows he was cruelly murther'd. At the very ſame point of time (as ſome obſerv'd) that <hi>Gio. Luigi,</hi> the ſole Author of his death, periſh'd unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately in the Water: The Revenge iſſuing from the hand of God at the ſame inſtant the Crime was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petrated by the order of the Earl. It was a thing that did beget wonder, that the Murtherers did not go preſently to <hi>Andrea's</hi> Houſe, conform to their firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, to ſecure themſelves at the ſame time of his life, who might once more give life to the Publick Liberty, and from whoſe wrath they might juſtly expect a ſignal Revenge, not only for his private In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:62940:119"/>but their publick Rebellion. But they abſtain'd perhaps by reaſon of the Confuſion, which a wicked Action is wont to cauſe in the minds of Bad men; or perhaps hindred by <hi>Girolamo</hi> the Brother of <hi>Gio. Luigi,</hi> who having thus diſpatch'd <hi>Giannettin,</hi> a young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, fierce and of reſolute Counſels, and his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions having, as he believ'd, ſeized the Galleys and ſubdued the City, did not much fear <hi>Andrea,</hi> a man of Eighty years, infirm of Body and ſtript of his Forces; nor perhaps, on the other ſide, was he willing the Souldiers greedy of Rapine, and altogether intent upon the prey, ſhould diſſipate and ſpoil thoſe preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Moveables, which he would reſerve intire for the needs and covetouſneſs of his Brother. In the mean time the Rumour increaſing more and more, and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drea</hi> not knowing whence it might ariſe, enquir'd often for <hi>Giannettin.</hi> At laſt he was told by a Servant, that the City was fallen into the Power of <hi>Gio. Luigi de Fieſchi;</hi> that the Commonwealth was in extream dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, the Galleys in the Power of the Conſpiratours, the People ſeditiouſly crying out <hi>Liberty,</hi> and calling upon the name of <hi>Fieſchi;</hi> nothing any where to be ſeen, but Slaughter, or heard, but threatnings of the Nobility, and his own life. <hi>Andrea</hi> not aſtoniſh'd, but overcome by a pity to his falling Countrey, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to remain a voluntary prey to thoſe Furies; ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, It was not fit he ſhould live after the ruine of his Countrey, but readily ſacrifice the poor Remains of his years to the laſt gaſpings of <hi>Genoua's</hi> Liberty. But his Wife with vehement Prayers accompanied with Tears, and with the loving violence of his Domeſticks haſtned his flight, telling him, 'Twas neceſſary he ſhould withdraw; that he ought to reſerve the laſt act of his Honour'd life for the Common Service; that he ſhould therefore be content to live, to get new
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:62940:120"/>Glory by renewing his Service to the Commonwealth, which again might be delivered by him: That now 'twas a time to authenticate his paſt Valour by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy, and to take Counſel of his own Vertue: That he ought to conſider, that upon the ſafety of his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon did depend the Hopes of his Countrey; which oppreſs'd for a while by the Fury of Bad men, could not deſpair of riſing again, as long as their Deliverer was free: That he ſhould go elſewhere to prepare Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies for the Publick wounds, which he could not hope to do now in <hi>Genoua:</hi> And that it was not a flight, but a charge his afflicted Countrey laid upon him for i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Amidſt theſe many and fortunate Atchievments of the Conſpiratours, <hi>Gio. Luigi</hi> being miſſing every one call'd upon him; but through the obſtinate Silence of every body in giving Tidings of him, there enter'd into their minds a neceſſary ſuſpicion of the fatal Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident. But for all this they did not abandon the courſe of their Victory; for leaving a good Guard at the Gates and upon the Galleys, two hundred of the ſtouteſt among them joyn'd with <hi>Girolamo,</hi> and went up and down the City, ſtirring up the People to take Arms: but with little fruit; for though at the firſt the name of <hi>Gio. Luigi</hi> did invite a great number of the Meaneſt ſort to follow, yet thoſe of any Account did not ſtir. Whether it were, that deſirous of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon quiet they abhorr'd that diſorderly Inſurrection; or whether they did not like, that a Nobleman backt by the Common people ſhould promote his own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ends; or, that they held themſelves ill treated by <hi>Gio. Luigi,</hi> who without their participation had put his hand to ſuch an important Enterprize; or
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:62940:120"/>laſtly, remembring the continued and grievous Exceſſes lately committed, they hated that manner of <hi>Plebeian</hi> Government, which caſting the Supream Dignities upon the Vileſt of the People, the Publick buſineſs was manag'd with ſmall Decorum; and the moſt diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult matters falling into the hands of perſons rough and uncapable, Reſolutions were form'd upon them always violent and precipitous.</p>
            <p>The City in the mean time was all in diſorder; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one madly running about, not knowing whither: enquiring mutually what might be the occaſion of ſuch a terrible uproar, without finding any body to anſwer: The Women at the Windows with Cries and Tears calling back their Husbands, Brothers and Sons: The amaz'd Nobility would have run to the Palace, but fear'd the plundring of their own Houſes: <hi>Caeſars</hi> Embaſſadour would have left <hi>Genoua,</hi> leſt he ſhould in his own perſon expoſe the Dignity of his Prince to ſome outrage; but being perſwaded to ſtay and aſſiſt the Commonwealth ſo devoted to <hi>Caeſar</hi> with his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Forces, he went preſently to the Palace, where he found divers of the Senatours, and concluded, with them to ſend fifty Souldiers to ſecure the Gate St. <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſo,</hi> which they valiantly attempted, but were beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en back. All this while <hi>G. Luigi</hi> could not be heard of; and <hi>Verrina,</hi> who ſaw the plot (hitherto well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted) was in danger without him, betook himſelf to the Galley, reſolving, if he ſaw things miſcarry, as 'twas to be fear'd, to withdraw himſelf from the danger by flying to <hi>Marſeille.</hi> The reſt of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiratours ſeeing neither him nor <hi>G. Luigi,</hi> one the Head, the other the Heart of the Conſpiracy, were not entirely ſatisfied of <hi>Girolamo,</hi> who unexperienc'd and fooliſhly heady, guided the matter rather with Impetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs than by ſound Advice. Nor did they find in themſelves that motive to Reverence, which is ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:62940:121"/>born to perſons of great Valour, and who for long time have been in poſſeſſion of a good opinion; whence they began not only to cool in their firſt fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vencies, but to look out for an opportunity to flie. Of ſo much moment is that good conceit which a Captain acquires amongſt his Souldiers. But an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, which in reaſon ought to have mortified the raſhneſs of <hi>Girolamo,</hi> extreamly heightned it; though not long after having inſpir'd him with an inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Ambition, it ſerv'd t ruine him. The certain News of <hi>Gio. Luigi's</hi> death was ſpread amongſt the Conſpiratours, and <hi>Girolamo</hi> conſidering he was left the abſolute Head of that Faction, would be likewiſe Heir to the Earls projects, and devouring in his ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination that Principality for himſelf, for which hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto he had ſought in the behalf of <hi>Gio. Luigi;</hi> with ſo much the more vehemency he attended to mature the fruits of his Victory, by how much he was flatter'd at hand with unexpected hopes; and by how much ſharper the Spur is that puts us upon acting for our own profit, than for anothers benefit. The Senatours and other Citizens aſſembled in the Palace, were not wanting to aſſiſt in this extream neceſſity of their Countrey: but not having Forces, nor knowing the deſigns of <hi>Gio.

<pb n="239" facs="tcp:62940:121"/>they now made election of other Gentlemen, who met with <hi>Girolamo</hi> and enquir'd for the Earl, that they might deliver to him what they had in Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. To which <hi>Girolamo</hi> anſwer'd, they were to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect no other Earl than himſelf, but ſhould preſently deliver up the Palace to him. From which impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and unſeaſonable Anſwer they collected the Earl was dead, and the <hi>Genoueſes</hi> began to take heart: for they returning to the Senate with the News of <hi>Fieſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chi's</hi> death, and the contumacy of <hi>Girolamo,</hi> twelve of the Nobility were order'd to aſſemble as many of the Common People and of the Guard as they could, to drive the remainder of the Conſpiratours out of the City, or to ſuppreſs them in it. But there was no need of fighting, for the Common people, which at name of Liberty were call'd forth, deſirous to plunder the Houſes of the Nobility, ſeeing the vanity of their hopes, and repenting the Sedition, did diſſipate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by degrees; and the Morning approaching none would be known for a Complice in the Conſpiracy; and others now ſainting, turn'd their thoughts rather upon that ſafety which they might owe to their own flight, than to the gain of others Victory. <hi>Girolamo</hi> now ſeeing the weakneſs of his own, and the ſtrength of thoſe Forces which were pick'd up to oppoſe him, knew not which way to turn himſelf; but as the beſt, bent his courſe toward the Gate <hi>del Arco.</hi> But in the Palace every one took heart, and ſome advis'd that they ſhould ſet upon the Squadron of <hi>Fieſchi</hi> already put into diſorder, and not vilifie the Majeſty of the Senate, by introducing Capitulations of Accord with Armed Rebels. But others more mature, oppoſing profitable to ſpecious Arguments, would not conſent: as well to ſpare the Blood of Citizens (of which a Prince or Captain is laudably covetous) as not to leave room for ſome unforeſeen event, which might over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:62940:122"/>the Affairs of the Commonwealth, now as it were in harbour. For by Publick Authority to put Arms into the hands of Citizens now in motion, and in the Night, whilſt many of them were ill ſatisfied of the preſent Government, and many now declared Rebels, was to diſturb by motion the humours of an infirm Body, which had need of being ſettled by repoſe. To <hi>Paolo Panſa</hi> then the honour fell, to heal by pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Advice that Evil, which he could not hinder by the preſervatives of his Exhortation. Brought there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore into the Senate, and having briefly given a ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction not neceſſary concerning his own Actions, he was ſent in the Name of the Senate to command <hi>Giro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamo</hi> depart the City, leaving his People behind him, on which condition the Senate would grant a General Pardon. <hi>Girolamo</hi> by the induſtry of <hi>Panſa</hi> was brought to condeſcend, and left <hi>Genoua,</hi> going with his Servants to <hi>Montobbio.

Nor would I coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel you to forego your life, if you had not loſt all that which made it dear to you, and were now to encounter all that which will render it hateful. Things are come to that paſs, a little delay will deprive you, as of the liberty of living, ſo of the liberty of dying. Nay, your evil Deſtiny hath not left you free to thought: 'tis not for <hi>Cleopatra</hi> to conſult whether ſhe ought to die, when 'tis reſolv'd ſhe muſt no longer Reign. They who can outlive Empire, never deſerv'd it. And what motives are wanting to determine you? You have hitherto own'd a Fortune more fruitful than your <hi>Nile;</hi> your Genius invok'd more than the gods of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt;</hi> your height of happineſs more aſtoniſhing than
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:62940:125"/>that of your <hi>Pyramides;</hi> and for you <hi>Africa</hi> hath been monſtrous only in Pleaſures. If you have fought, you have been victorious: when you have fled you have been follow'd; as if your flight were more worthy to be attended than others Triumphs. You have reign'd, and <hi>Caeſars</hi> have got Trophies only for you, whilſt your <hi>Antony</hi> hath thrown into your boſom the hopes of the Univerſe. What can you wiſh, but to have died then? What can you fear, but to loſe the opportunity of dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now? Perhaps you would have expir'd Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding, and ſo abandon'd Fortune, rather than now leave the World when Fortune hath left you: ſome have choſen to put a period to their life, rather than ſee the end of their happineſs. But what we do that we may not become miſerable, we ought to do that we may ceaſe to be ſo. The beſt of Fortune is not to taſt of miſeries, next to that is to know how to end them. If you be not follow'd to your Sepulchre with the pompous train of your Subjects, at leaſt you ſhall not make one of that ignominious troop, which muſt ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to the pride of your Enemies. Though you do not triumph in death by a Royal Funeral, at leaſt your ſelf ſhall not make up a part of the <hi>Roman</hi> Triumph; and though you do not die Queen in <hi>Egypt,</hi> you ſhall not live a ſlave in <hi>Italy.</hi> And though you could diſmiſs that fear, and entertain a hope from the generouſneſs of your Conquerour to be re-inſtated in your Throne, would you accept from his hand that which before you ow'd only to the bounty of Heaven, and ſo become twice a ſlave, to your Enemies force, and to his courteſie? Would you re-aſcend, to fall again from that height whence you have already faln? What can you enjoy, which you have not enjoy'd? Can the wit of Fortune or Nature preſent you any new happineſs? Would it not poſe your moſt exquiſite deſires to fancy more? Hath not the Sea produc'd new Treaſures, not only for
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:62940:126"/>your ornament, but for your luxury? Is not Nature weary in diſtilling ſtrange pleaſures for you? What kind of honour is there, that hath not paid Tribute to your Scepter? and are you not cloy'd? How many have kill'd themſelves, being wearied in a tedious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition of the ſame happineſs? He hath liv'd enough, that hath perfectly enjoy'd. What ſhould we do, when we can meet nothing new but Miſchiefs? You live not now to live, but becauſe you have not cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to die. And ſuppoſe a return of your firſt good Fortune, ſhall your <hi>Antony</hi> return again? But I flatter you, O Queen. Nor <hi>Antony,</hi> nor Kingdom, or ought of your firſt eſtate remains for you: only reſts thoſe miſeries, which are not to be allay'd with thoughts of not deſerving them; for who would not accompany, or will not follow <hi>Antony,</hi> merits worſe. Perhaps you relie on the kind offers of <hi>Auguſtus:</hi> But reflect upon the vaſt Treaſures you have hid, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that thoſe feed with hopes who deſire poſſeſſion. Perhaps his courteous Viſit in your ſickneſs comforts you, but the veyl with which he would have ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow'd his Pride was too tranſparent: he was content you ſhould fall at his feet with the tremblings of a ſick, as well as of an unfortunate perſon: he ſuffer'd you to imbrace his knees with thoſe hands, whoſe beck once commanded the ſame petitionary poſture in a Kingdom. He was ſlow to raiſe you up, and under a feign'd ſweetneſs cloaking an imperious gravity, with ſcant ſpeech he bid you to hope well. But he that would have you hope for what is in his power to give, would obtain ſomewhat himſelf; but means not, you ſhould ever obtain what he bid you hope for. Conſider what cunning that man is maſter of, that could reſiſt your powerful charms: and ſince you could not draw him into the ſnares of your beauty, take heed you fall not into thoſe of his ambition. Conſider, that life cannot
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:62940:126"/>be good for you; ſince your Enemy deſires it: and he bids you live, that gives you nothing but hope, and could give you what he would.</p>
            <p>You are too fair a Spoil for a Triumph. Nor can <hi>Auguſtus</hi> better repair his loſs (ſeeing <hi>Antony</hi> hath ſcap'd his hands by death) than by leading you in triumph, who have triumphed over <hi>Antony.</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare then to grace the <hi>Tiber</hi> with a new ſpectacle: To ſhew your ſelt, not as once your <hi>Antony</hi> deſign'd to preſent you, but in Servile habit, a ſlave amidſt a throng of Slaves; your Hair diſhevel'd, perhaps ſhav'd; Bare-foot, going before or following the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot of your proud Lord; pointed at by Children, mock'd by the Licentious Souldier, thus ſcoſt at by the <hi>Roman</hi> Matrons, There goes the great Queen, not of <hi>Egypt,</hi> but of Whores; There's the mighty <hi>Amazon,</hi> who overthrew Emperours—upon a Feather-bed; See, how with down caſt eye ſhe is come to teach our Virgins modeſty. And is all this ſupportable? Have you the heart to expoſe your ſelf to the outrages of the wrong'd <hi>Octavia?</hi> No breaſt more true to hatred than a Womans, no Woman more cruel than a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val. How often hath ſhe preſerr'd her Vows to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that ſhe might with her own hands tear out thoſe eyes of yours, whoſe wounding influence mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd affection in the heart of her Husband? How often hath ſhe covenanted with the gods at the price of her own life, to rip up that boſom which hath ſo long uſurp'd poſſeſſion of her <hi>Antony?</hi> And will ſhe not now uſe her good Fortune? will not her fond Brother <hi>Auguſtus</hi> beſtow you upon her, that ſhe might ſhare in his Victory? Unhappy Queen! methinks I ſee thoſe baſe Services ſhe deſigns you. Thoſe taunts with which ſhe will wound your Soul: upbraiding you with diſſolv'd Pearl, when ſhe appoints you a draught of Wormwood: commanding you to put her
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:62940:127"/>into that dreſs which catch'd the heart of <hi>Antony.</hi> In fine, I ſee, and with horrour conſider the Scorns, the Abuſes, with which a great, a provok'd Lady and a Miſtreſs will take revenge of paſt wrongs. Call to mind then, what becomes you as a Queen. Behold the magnanimous <hi>Dido</hi> opening her boſom with a generous blow. She might by living have reveng'd her ſelf on him that betray'd her; you in not dying, betray him that lov'd you. She remain'd a Queen, you have loſt your Crown. Or if you would take a leſſon of freedom out of that <hi>Rome,</hi> whither you are a deſtin'd Slave; conſider <hi>Lucrece,</hi> and ſee if the loſs of a Kingdom requires as much as the loſs of an opinion. If that publick ſhame which attends you weighs with her ſecret diſgrace. But why do I muſter Examples, when you have before you that of your dead <hi>Antony?</hi> If his memory be not enough to ſteel you with reſolution, what Argument is ſufficient? If this be not enough, unhappy <hi>Antony!</hi> thou art deceiv'd. Thou didſt never believe, that the Lady thou eſteem'dſt worthy to receive Kingdoms in gift from thee; whom to follow when ſhe fled, thou thought'ſt no leſs glory than to purſue a flying Enemy; in whoſe boſom to recover thy ſelf, ſeem'd a ſufficient recompence for the loſs of half the World; thou never thought'ſt, I ſay, that ſhe had a heart capable of Servitude. Thou haſt not ſcap'd by death, but art ſtill ſubjected to thy proud Rival, who triumphs over thee in <hi>Cleopatra.</hi> See, a noble teſtimony of a grateful heart! <hi>Cleopatra</hi> conſiders not which is beſt, to live or to die; but whether in Chains by the violences of the inrag'd <hi>Octavia,</hi> or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhe ſhould now ſnatch an Antidote from Death againſt the malice of her Fortune, and unite her ſelf for ever to thy bleſſed Shade. Call to mind your <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony,</hi> when ſtain'd with the blood of thoſe Veins his own bold hand had open'd; when he threw himſelf
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:62940:127"/>into your imbraces, and ſeem'd to live no other life than what you breath'd into him by your laſt kiſſes; when with an undaunted courage he fronted his Fate, and taught you thoſe ſteps which the unfortunately Magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous ought to tread. You then fill'd his breaſt with mighty hopes, imprecated the worſt of <hi>Roman</hi> Slavery, if you did not follow him, whilſt he imbrac'd you as if he had hugg'd Victory in his arms, and with an inviting ſmile bid you haſten alter him, and expir'd. And will you deceive the honour'd Aſhes of that mighty Hero, which from their Urne ſeem thus to ſummon you? There advances but a few minutes, O <hi>Cleopatra;</hi> you may die when you will, but you cannot die free when you will. If you kill your ſelf now, you do it to beſtow your ſelf on me; if afterwards, 'tis to ſteal your ſelf from others. Give that life up to your Love, which ſhortly will be uſurp'd by your impatience. But if thou wilt live, withal remember when thou ſhalt be in <hi>Rome,</hi> that the Body of thy <hi>Antony</hi> is in <hi>Egypt.</hi> Now what remains, but that I conjure you by theſe private walks, the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretaries of both your Fortunes, where you have liv'd free, and may die free; by your Houſhould gods, and more by the genius of <hi>Antony,</hi> your Sovereign <hi>Jove,</hi> (which without doubt hovers in the Air about us) that you will not by your weakneſs make <hi>Egypt</hi> bluſh, where you have been Queen, and may by your Courage be number'd amongſt her Deities?</p>
